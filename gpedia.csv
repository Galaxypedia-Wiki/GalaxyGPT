The '''Scout Component''' is an [[:Category:Event Item|Event Item]] used as a trade in for the quest ''Dire times and Dead ships'', which gave 8k Credits found within the [[U.N.E Starbase]] during the [[Ultimate Retro Event 2022]].\
\
The '''Scout Component''' was also featured as an [[:Category:Event Item|Event Item]] for the [[Halloween Event 2022]] which gave players 40k if they sold it but due to a mistake Scout Components were far more expensive than intended. As of now it gives 8,000 Credits.\
\
\
=== Trivia ===\
This item can give 8,000 Credits instead of 40,000 due to a recent update as a refund when it is inside your ship when a round ends, or when a server gets shut down.\

"Territory","'''''Territory''''' is how much area a [[Factions|faction]] has (i.e. How far faction ships have ventured into space). You generally gain more '''Territory''' the higher your faction's power level, which is tied to the amount of ore in your base. The more ore there is, the faster the gain in power and territory. If you lose too much or have another faction completely take your faction's territory over, then you could possibly be [[Assimilations|assimilated]] into another faction. '''Territory''' also influences which faction owns starbases and planets (at times the '''Territory''' between two or more factions will clash against each other). There is a non-assimilation area surrounding the [[Mega Base]]. Once 95% of '''Territory''' is conquered by one or more factions, the [[endgame]] begins. Territory will also show on the minimap. \

The '''Minimap''' is the main method of determining the enemy fleet size, location and faction power at a glance.

{{Picture_Infobox_Mk_II|title1 = Earth|image1 = Earth edited.jpg}}\
==Description==\
Earth was the first planet to ever be added to Galaxy. It was added in Pre-Alpha and stayed through Alpha before it was removed in Beta. The planet served as a spawn point from when you first joined and game and also served as the icon and thumbnail for the game. The planet was located just under where the [[Mega Base]] is located today, indicating that it may have been a location marker for where the [[Mega Base]] was going to be placed. You could fly your spaceship to it, jump out and walk around. This was a very small planet when compared to others. It appears that [[wikipedia:Pangaea_Proxima|Pangea Proxima]] is forming on it, suggesting a radical jump forward from our time.\
\
Later, the Earth was re-added temporarily for the [[:Category:April Fools 2020|2020 April Fools event]], in which it served as the starting point for a quest line to receive the [[Baby Tyrant]], although the Freedom Base was later used to pick up the quest.\

"Smallketchup82_Fiverr_Event","On 08/01/2022, Galaxy Developer smallketchup82 paid someone on fiverr to read out a famous [[Copypasta|Galaxy Copypasta]]\
\
== Overview ==\
<div style=\"float: right;\"><youtube>X3cmD_q3kCY</youtube></div>\
On January 8th, 2022, the Galaxy Developer smallketchup82 went onto fiverr and paid someone $10 CAD to read out a Galaxy Copypasta. The video features an African American male with a Nigerian accent reading out the copypasta, then sobbing afterwards.\
\
The copypasta:\
<blockquote>\"Hey can someone tell me why my ship died here: We were attaking a base, with a proto x-1, a couple liegionarres, a tenna, and my apoc. The other team's x-1 spesifically targets my apoc, and I warp like three times away from them, and they keep chasing me to my death. why me?\"</blockquote>\
\
smallketchup82 had said that him and another Galaxy Developer, XxChaoticStrike were actually planning on doing this for a while but didn't have the money to do so. They wanted to have BigManTyrone being the one to read out the copypasta, but it would've cost $60 CAD and they weren't able to afford that. So instead smallketchup82 opted to just pay some random guy on fiverr to read it out."

'''Galaxy Development''' is a more updated version of Galaxy that is used to test future ships or updates for the game. Access costs 1,000 Robux, and once inside, you start with 100,000 credits and 10% to 12% loyalty (depends on if you own the [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass]] or not). In this game, [[Galaxy Staff|Galaxy Admins]] are allowed to give you any ship that is worth less than 250,000 credits, as well as many credits or as many materials as you want. Access to the game has been cheaper in the past, once being a measly 25 Robux, then being raised to 500 Robux, and then finally to the 1,000 Robux it is today. Please note that you are not entitled to obtaining ships in the development server, and that admins can freely kick you for bothering them. It may be possible that they can ban you. If you get kicked because there is an event active in dev, you will not be able to join until the event is over. This causes someone who has paid for galaxy dev to be unable to play on galaxy dev rather frequently.\

The '''''Space Pumpkin''''' is an item used by the player to make [[:Category:Limited|Event Ships]] during the Halloween Events in Galaxy.\
\
== Halloween Event 2018 ==\
The '''Space Pumpkin''' is a special item used to create limited ships during the [[Halloween Event 2018]]. They can be looted from [[Alien Harvest Servitor]]s (2 each) or [[Harvest King]]s (30 each). The versions used in this event take up 50 cubic meters in a Cargo Hold and can be sold for 1200 credits (and bought for around 1300).\

Previously, '''Space Pumpkins''' were the materials needed to be collected for the [[Halloween Quest]]. (Five were needed to complete the quest). You got them by defeating and looting the [[Grim Reaper|Grim Reaper.]] However, it may have taken many [[Grim Reaper]] kills and fights to get enough of these, as people often quickly stole them and ran off. These also could have been bought via the [[Mega Base]]. They could be bought for 1,650 credits and sold for 1,350 credits.\

Well known Galaxy Community Member & Developer. Mostly known for his role in causing the [[Enigma Cache Incident]]. He is also known for trolling in the Galaxy Discord Server.\
== Story ==\
PataNautic started playing Galaxy in 2015 on a different account, but has been playing on his main account (PataNautic) since 2018. Pata became a modeller for Galaxy at an unspecified date but estimated a few months prior to the events of the [[Enigma Cache Incident]]. After developers Juice and GalaxyOrigins were demoted by rcouret (\"rc\") for \"inactivity\", rc did not want any new developers for a while. Eventually the Galaxy Community convinced him to let Pata be a developer, in which Pata was ranked to developer. Pata started to push out updates that the community longed for. Eventually Pata would release an update which started the events known as the [[Enigma Cache Incident]] and resulted in his demotion from developer. Pata would go to regain his developer rank in early 2022.\

Pata was a very important figure within the [[Enigma Cache Incident]], he is one of the reason's it occurred despite it not being entirely his fault.\

Only the most Die-Hard Galaxy fans will ever have this Epic item. Once you have this you can use the [[Commands|:music command]] to blast whatever song or song list you want out of your ship. (Must be a Roblox Song ID). It currently costs 2500 Robux.\
\
== Cost and Bonuses ==\
The '''''Ship Stereo System Gamepass''''' currently costs 2500 robux. In addition to being able to play literally a lot of music tracks in game, players who own the gamepass will also receive a special role on discord with proper verification; the <u>Stereo</u> role, if you will, and a in-game chat tag colored orange and called <span style=\"color: #FF5900;\">[STEREO]</span>, if the person also has the [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP Gamepass]], the in-game chat tag will be called <span style=\"color: #FF5900;\">[VIP|STEREO]</span> instead.\
\
== Bugs/Issues ==\
For an unknown reason, the Stereo Gamepass may cut off songs early, this currently needs to be looked into and may be fixed in the future. \
* The main reason for the music cutting off is mainly caused by spinning the camera or using [[Warp Drive]].\

For acquiring this material easier, lure bosses such as [[Punisher]] and [[Galleon]] to your Starbase, so that the Starbase gets the [[Money Making|Combat Reward]] of the dead boss, giving your base credits and speeding up the process of upgrading your base to Level 5. When [[Sieging]] a Level 5 Base, use powerful, siege ships like the [[Hasatan]], [[Avalon]], and the [[Kraken]] to make the process of sieging go faster. To prevent the faction you wish to siege from disappearing, use an alt to make it stay in that faction and to prevent it.\

'''Factions''' are one of the major aspects of the game. When you first join Galaxy, you are greeted with a menu to create or join a''' faction'''. The player who creates the''' faction''' will get to pick the colour and name. There is a maximum of ten '''factions''' per server (Five for [[Galaxy Arcade]]) and  '''factions '''cannot be created during [[Endgame]]. '''Factions''' are able to war each other or ally with each other. Each '''faction''' comes with its own [[Starbase]]. If all [[Starbase|Starbases]] that''' faction''' owns are destroyed, it is defeated and that team is removed.\
\
== Leaders ==\
The player who creates the '''faction''' is the leader. This gives them permissions to upgrade their [[Starbase]](s), declare [[War]], make peace, and propose [[Alliances]], as well as other '''faction''' management options. After the leader leaves the game or '''faction''', another player is selected leader at random, or the leader can appoint someone else as the leader to take their place.\
\
== Base Credits ==\
[[Starbase|Starbases]] need [[Credits]] to be able to buy materials and be upgraded, they are generated automatically from negative taxes or the base's own income, which is earned from territory. A base can reach negative credits if people dump enough [[Ores]].[[File:Create a faction.JPG|thumb|239x239px]]\

The '''Plagued Preos Juvenile''' is similar to the [[Plagued Preos Hatchling]], but has a somewhat larger and more complex model. It is also more well-armed and drops better loot.\

• The Juvenile appears to use an advanced version of the AI seen in regular Kneall and Pirate ships. It will attempt to stay 2-3k away from the player, similar to the Hatchling \
==Loot==\
*6-10 Preos Bits \

==Strategy==\
\
* Similar strategies to killing the Juvenile as with the [[Plagued Preos Hatchling|Hatchling]]\
* Use of a dreadnought is recommended to kill the Juvenile, but a skilled player may be able to solo it with a battleship\
*It's health is mainly composed of hull points so get a ship with dps slightly into hull shredding over shield.\

== Description ==\
The '''LMNOP''' is a ''[[Nyx]]'' sized admin ship. There is not much known about its origins.\
\
== Appearance ==\
The '''LMNOP''' has a rather empty interior. The exterior teleporter leads you to a huge unfinished and empty room with the pilot seat and a \"Systems Online\" screen in front of it. Behind the teleporter you came from lays another yellow teleporter that leads you to what would be the fighter bay of a Carrier-class ship. Since there are no fighters contained in there, it's just a long empty hallway spanning the entire ship's length.\
\
== Advantages ==\
* High damage resistance. (90%)\
* High health\
* Its speed cap is the fastest it can be in-game.\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Has no weapons.\
* Somewhat plain-looking compared to more popular admin ships.\
* Very large, so it's easy to target.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''LMNOP''' was a scrapped carrier model that was given up. The developer TeenTitansGoHomee found the ship and placed it as an admin ship.\

"Transport_Vessel","{{Offsale}}\
\
== Description ==\
The Transport Vessel is part of a new update which allows players to create outposts if they meet the criteria. It has the same model as the [[E Class]] and same interior.

}}\
The Transport Vessel appears exactly the same as the freighter '''E Class''' does, although there is no exit to the interior. If you wish to get out of a Transport Vessel, you '''NEED''' to have an AI faction kill you or a player faction kill you. You '''cannot get out''' until the ship is dead.\
\
== Outpost Making ==\
[[File:Video2.mp4|thumb|Here is the vessel making an outpost]]\
If the criteria for making an outpost is met, the Transport Vessel will spawn and slowly lumber on its own to the spot wanted. Once the spot is met, it will start spinning around and eventually, make another starbase. \
\
== Trivia ==\
\
* On 3/19/23, a dev accidently released Transport Vessels to the Build Menu for free, allowing players to obtain the ship.\

"Score","''Not to be confused with [[Bounty]].''\
\
== Description ==\
'''''Score''''' is the latest game mechanic to be added. '''Score''' is a good way to tell how much experience and play-time players have. You gain '''Score''' from killing [[Aliens]], [[Mining]], [[Trading]], killing [[Pirating|Fellow Players]] and so on. Therefore, players with higher '''Score''' have done more of these things and tend to be more experienced than lower '''Score''' players. Keep in mind that this is not ''always'' the case. '''Score''' saves, so when you leave and come back you will have the same '''Score''' as you had when you left. '''Score''', unlike [[Bounty]], cannot be lost, so there is no risk to your '''Score''' if you lose a ship.\

"Damage_Resistance","{{Removed}}\
\
'''Damage Resistance''' is a property of [[Ships]] and [[Starbase]]s affecting how much damage Turrets and Spinals do relative to their base damage stats.\
==Description==\
Damage resistance varies with a [[Ships|Ship's]] class and changes the amount of damage a ship receives from a given source.\
\
For example, suppose a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] had 2500 [[Shields|Shield]] and it was hit by a [[Turrets|Turret]] with a base damage of 125. The true damage the ship would take would be reduced by the percent relative to the ship's class, in this case, Battlecruiser. If Battlecruisers had a base damage resistance of 0-5%, the ship would take a maximum of 125 damage (0% reduction) or a minimum of 118.75 (5% reduction; 125 - 5% of 125 = 118.75).\
\
Damage resistance values were updated in version .70. Most ships saw increases in resistance. Miner/Freighter resistance was increased from 10 to 15%; Frigate resistance was increased from 20% to 25%; Dreadnought resistance was increased from 35% to 38%; Super Capital resistance was increased from 35% to 42%; Alien resistance was decreased from 30% to 25%. Additionally, Starbase resistance was decreased from 50% to 45%.\
\
It was further altered in .71c.\
\
Damage Resistance was removed in .76b26\

[[File:Alien Ycto 2 (by rockpop2011).png|thumb|Another Yctogriv, taken from up close.]]\
== Appearance ==\
It's a small, flat ship with a smaller size than a [[Swarmer]], with some exterior detailing.\

* Use a strong anti AA ship such as the [[Tempest]].\
* The warp effect can still be seen, so if you see a ship warping that doesn't appear on the minimap, you've likely located it.\
* It can be called to fight by other [[Kneall]] ships, so if you see a [[Punisher]] or [[Decimator]] attack something, it won't be far behind.\
==Loot==\
The Yctogriv drops one Scout Component and has no combat reward.\
==Trivia==\
• Using the :info or :cost command on an Alien Yctogriv will come up with a box titled \"Scrambled\" and some text reading, \"The data about that object seems to be encrypted.\" Using the latter command will also add \"Must be top secret.\"\

The '''''Dissonance''''' is a small destroyer that excels in swarms. It is a black and yellow ship with a large, central globe.\
\
== Behaviour ==\
Will detect players/enemy AI from up to around 30,000 studs away, proceeding to simply chase it until the target dies, the ship itself dies, or it loses sight of the target. Will follow the call of larger allied pirate ships, but cannot call itself.\

<h1>Overview</h1>[[File:Galaxy Arcade.png|centre|Galaxy Arcade Icon]]\
'''Galaxy Arcade''' is a more new-player friendly version of Galaxy. Players start off with 7500 credits and can earn more, but the count resets back to 7500 every time you join the game making some quest ships nearly impossible to get (e.g. [[Hyperion]]). All [[ships]] are free to buy, so you don't have to earn anything and can fly without fear of losing your ship. Players may build all ships though the Cruiser class without a gamepass,\
all ships of higher classes require ROBUX-bought gamepasses to build. [[:Category:VIP Ship|VIP Ships]] of any class can be bought at half price. Previously, this was not the case, as VIP ships were able to be bought for free as long as you owned the gamepass.\
\
The map in '''Galaxy Arcade''' is a lot smaller than in Galaxy, and the game is limited to five [[Factions|player factions]] instead of the usual ten.\
\
Some people say '''Galaxy Arcade''' isn't fun because of \"Pay-to-Win kids\", as all [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]], [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] cost ROBUX. However, '''Galaxy arcade''' can be nice if you want to fight without fear of losing expensive ships, and can be useful for testing new updates, new ship mechanics, taking screenshots, etc.\

==Description==\
The '''Key2''' is an Admin Ship. On its own, it is definitely the worst Admin Ship out there, but it is needed for two admin-only quests that are used to spawn the '''[[Kneall Prototype]]''' and the '''[[Pleb's Kodiak]]'''.\
==Interior==\
The '''Key2''' has no interior.\
==Advantages==\
\
*High damage resistance. (90%)\
\
==Disadvantages==\
\
*Has no weapons.\
*Terrible speed for an admin ship.\
*Terrible turnspeed for an admin ship.\
*Low health for an admin ship.\
\
==Trivia==\
\
*In order to use this ship for the admin-only quests, you must spawn a '''Y.Part()''' and find a hidden teleporter located on the ship. You will then be teleported to a baseplate with 6 screens. Currently there are only 3 quests there - Admin Quest 1 spawns two '''UNE Sovereign-X'''s (currently broken), Admin Quest 2 spawns a '''Kneall Prototype''', and Admin Quest 3 spawns a '''Pleb's Kodiak'''. The only way to complete the quests is by exchanging a '''Key2''' along with another one of the '''Keys'''.\
*One of the worst admin ships out there, and it would be completely useless if it weren't for the admin quests.\
*Shares its model with '''[[Key]]''', '''[[Key1]]''', and '''[[Key3]]'''.\

==Description==\
The '''Malice''' is an Admin Ship based on the Vaygr Battlecruiser built for [[Galaxy Staff|Lordmoneymonkey]]. Try to kill it if you dare, or are patient enough. The ship has disparate dimensions, being quite thin compared to its length and height. This makes it less vulnerable from the top or front, but much easier to attack from either side. It features a number of team-colored plates and spikes, along with a central glowing beam, above which a small bridge/viewport area sits.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior is nothing but a small gray room, a blue screen, and a small pilot seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Extremely high health, the '''Malice''' is the tankiest admin ship in the game.\
* Decent maneuverability.\
* 90% damage resistance.\
* Starbases and NPCs don't aim for admin ships.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No weapons.\
* Very large and easy to hit.\
== Version History ==\
* Removed along with most of the admin ships in version .62a1.\
* Brought back in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* It was the slowest admin ship in Galaxy for a very long time until the Key and its variations were created.\

"The_Blackhawks","'''The Blackhawks''' (Abbreviated BH) is a Galaxy clan known for their activity, members, and extreme toxicity in the Beta stages of Galaxy. It was founded by [[teentitansgohomee]] and was managed by his friend minecraftninja5. BH had a large amount of kill logs during their time active. Around the time that Galaxy Gamma released, BH saw a huge wave of inactivity and the faction as a whole decided to quit Galaxy and move to other games.\
== Synopsis ==\
The Blackhawks was originally founded by [[teentitansgohomee]] in mid Galaxy Beta. It started off as a clan containing some of teen's friends, but quickly grew to house many different members. BH was led by teen's friend, minecraftninja5 near this time. BH started to cultivate a reputation of one of Galaxy's most racist clans. 2019 was the Blackhawks' peak, they mostly did fleet battles during this time. In late 2020, BH started experiencing a lot of inactivity. By early 2021, BH was rarely seen with little members actively talking in the Discord Server. In mid 2021, BH decided to disband after minecraftninja5 chose to leave the faction. Many members moved to Rogue Lineage, while a fraction of the clan quit the ROBLOX platform entirely.\
\
\
In late 2021, a new version of the Blackhawks was created and was tagged \"Blackhawks 2\". This faction was also founded by [[teentitansgohomee]] but was led by [[smallketchup82]]. The faction had attracted a few original Blackhawks members, and got a few notable kills, but eventually met the same demise as the original Blackhawks. Both the original Blackhawks and Blackhawks 2 Discord Servers have been archived with nobody allowed to speak. Members of the original BH are not seen commonly.\

An egg-shaped ship with phasers that spawns every 45 minutes in a server and only needs one player to spawn.\
\
==Behavior==\
\
* Summons all aliens on the server when attacked.\
* Cannot be lured, as it does not give chase to players.\
*Can not warp.\
*Spawns every 45 min.\
\
==Loot==\
*45 Preos Bits\
*1 Embryo (rarely 2 embryos)\
\
==Strategy==\
\
* Destroy all other aliens before attacking the egg, as a fleet of hatchlings and juveniles can do massive damage.\
*Use Wasps to attack the ''Plagued Preos Egg'' and get the Hatchlings and Juveniles to focus on you, then warp to a high-level [[Starbase]] and let it kill the Hatchlings and Juveniles. Once the Egg is alone or has little Hatchlings on the map, spawn a ship to kill the Egg.\

==Version History==\
\
* Spawn time reduced from 90 minutes to 45 minutes, amount of Preos Bits increased from 45 to 10, amount of Embryos reduced from 2 to 1, gained the ability to drop 2 Embryos instead of 1 in version .74b4.\

== Advantages ==\
* Pretty fast.\
* Very menacing name, it can scare away a lot of newer players.\
* The Kodiak A's model noticeably smaller than the regular [[Kodiak]]'s model, so it is harder to hit.\
* Starbases and NPCs won't attack admin ships.\
* Admins can add admin ships to themselves whenever they want, so they are pretty much free.\

"Hull","__NOTOC__\
== Description ==\
The '''''Hull''''' is “the main body of a ship or other vessel, including the bottom, sides, and deck of the ship, but not including the masts, superstructure, rigging, engines, and other fittings on the ship”. In Roblox Galaxy, '''Hull''' is the armor integrity of a ship that is calculated through materials used, ship class, and armour shape/form.\
==Advantages of Hull==\
The '''Hull''' is the primary armour and exterior of a ship. '''Hull''' is calculated by what class the ship is, what materials are used, and the shape/form of the armour. The Hull (or ship armour) can resist damage from incoming [[Spinals|Phasers]] and any [[Turrets|Shield Damaging Turrets]]. Hull tanks can be useful in [[Sieging|sieges]], as [[Starbase|Starbases]] have mainly shield-based turrets.\
==Disadvantages of Hull==\
While the '''Hull''' is the primary armour of a ship, It's better to retreat when your [[Shields]] are down, or before your hull hits critical levels. The Hull takes more damage from incoming [[Spinals|Cannons]] and [[Turrets|Hull Damaging Turrets]]. Unless you're sure you can take on an enemy ship while currently at low '''Hull''' and no [[Shields]], it's better to get your health back up before fighting again. Hull is less useful than shields in most cases, as many ships are hull breakers and hull does not regenerate slowly away from safety like [[shields]]. It also regenerates slower when docked than [[shields]].\
== Overall ==\
In short, having a ship with strong '''Hull''' health can help you survive battles longer. With more disadvantages than advantages, it's better to compensate low ship health with good pvp skills and evasive reflexes to survive longer in combat.\

'''''Collins''''' is an NPC that allows players to complete the \"Iron Forge\" quest.\
{{Infobox NPC\
|title = Collins\
|image1 = CollinsNPC.png\
|type = Quest-giver}}\
==Description==\
'''Collins''' is an NPC found in [[Frion I]] that acts as the completion point for quest 204, \"Iron Forge,\" <s>initiated by [[Smith]].</s> \
\
Smith is the new quest giver for Armor Platings. \
==Location==\
'''Collins''' can be found inside the cavity below the main base/spawnpoint in Frion I. He can only be accessed once Frion I is upgraded to level 2, which enables a teleporter found on the top of the planet that transports players inside the cavity. He stands on top of a ledge of grass-covered stone engraved with text in the alien alphabet.\
\
[[File:CollinsLocation.png|400px]]\
==Quest Dialogue==\
<u>Collins</u>: \"Who are you?\"\
\
<u>Player</u>: \"Can you make me some Armor Platings?\"\
\
<u>Collins</u>: \"..is that all?\"\
\
<u>Player</u>: \"Yes.\"\
\
''Note: dialogue below this point is unfinished and should be filled in if possible''\
\
<u>Collins</u>: \"I'll charge you 5K and 150 Armor Scraps, but I'll make 3.\"\
\
<u>Player</u>: \"Fine by Me\"\
\
<u>Collins</u>: \"Okay, come back if you need anything else.\"\
\
''150 Armor Scraps and 5,000 credits are taken from the player if available; player receives three Armored Plating in their [[Warehouse]].''\
\
PLEASE NOTE THAT COLLINS IS NOW DISABLED AND THE QUEST \"IRON FORGE\" IS DONE IN THE MEGA BASE.\
\
THE PRICES ARE IDENTICAL FOR THE RECORD.\
==Trivia==\
*'''Collins''' is currently unanchored, allowing players to push the NPC around and even move it outside of the planet.\
*No longer in use due to the fact Smith now sells the Armor Platings instead of Collins at the Mega Base.\

"Slarfie","<div style=\"float:middle\">[[File:NEUTRAL FLAG (fixed).png|thumb|688x688px|The Slarfie Flag.]]</div>\
The Slarfie is an alien race from the same species as the [[Kneall]] but are peaceful instead of warmongerers. \
\
The Slarfie has an embassy located in the [[Mega Base]] and there are various Slarfie npcs hidden both inside and outside the [[Mega Base]].\
\
''Currently, 3 confirmed ships have been made by them, The [[Hevnetier]], [[Kodiak]] and the [[Slipstream]].''\
\
== Slarfie Lore ==\
Not all of the Kneall are driven for war and conquest. In the year 2460, the Kneall society was struck by political division and civil war over the continued militarization of their people. Many were opposed to the continued subjugation of lesser worlds, and fought for the freedom and unity of non. From the ashes of a long and brutal conflict, a unified group of revolutionaries gained independence from the Kneall, branding themselves as \"Slarfie\", which roughly translates to english as \"Exiled Ones\". Over the next couple centuries, their technological advancements and infrastructure branched in a different direction to that of the Kneall, adding to the growing differences of their societies. Currently, the U.N.E. is partnered with the Slarfie governing body in a mutually beneficial trade and defense pact. The U.N.E. have proven to be helpful allies to Slarfie leadership in their ongoing fight with the Kneall.\
\
A sect of the Slarfie navy pledged itself to A’vell after contact with a fragment of the dark god in deep space, creating the first Avellian crusade.\

"Endgame","'''''Endgame''''' ''is the final phase in a round of Galaxy. This is not the same as a \"Final Round.\"''\
\
== Description ==\
'''Endgame''' is a period in Galaxy gameplay during which [[Factions]] cannot be created. Additionally, a faction can win that round of Galaxy by either eliminating all other factions or by taking over 90% of the territory. '''Endgame''' does not begin until a total of 95% of open space has been converted into all factions' territories, including NPC factions. If '''Endgame''' is active, flashing words will appear where [[Loyalty]] is displayed saying \"ENDGAME ACTIVE.\" Some players think that during '''Endgame '''everyone is supposed to go to war, but that isn't always the case.\
\
Additionally, '''Endgame''' increases the capital ship counts per faction from three [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] to four and from four [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] to five. The [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] and [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super-Capital]] counts remain the same (one). Another effect of '''Endgame''' is that faction leaders cannot kick players in their [[Factions|faction]] and no new [[alliances]] can be created. [[Loyalty]] will also increase at a boosted rate while '''Endgame''' is active.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* While '''Endgame '''simply resets the server upon a faction's victory, the similarly colored \"Final Round\" warning will shut down a Galaxy server when the server is abandoned or after a faction wins.\
* If only one player faction exists on a server when '''Endgame''' conditions are met (95% map territory is occupied), then the server will declare whichever faction (player or NPC) has more territory the winner of the round and will initiate a reset.\

}}\
== Description ==\
The Prototype X-4 is a unique admin-class ship with an unconventional model. It also has a subtle ambience, accompanied by a very large icon on the mini-map.\
== Advantages ==\
*''Might'' scare inexperienced players due to this ship's stats being secret (cannot be obtained via the :info command), the name, and the icon being very large on the map.\
== Disadvantages ==\
*The ship's model isn't all that well optimized, as it is literally old ship models welded together into one structure. It could end up causing lag if you ram it into something.\
*Ambience may cause other players to be annoyed and ask you to de-spawn the ship.\
== Strategy ==\
*Use this ship as a flying meme, or to scare off inexperienced players.\
== Version History ==\
*This carrier used to possess [[Striker]]s and Vectors, both being removed from the ship and the former reworked into an actual [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] in an unknown version.\
*Ship stats were made secret in version .75a5.\
== Trivia ==\
*This ship is well known for the model (being old, previously used ship models welded together), and its ambience.\
**One can make out at a glance the [[Slipstream]]'s, [[Nyx]]'s, and [[Nemesis]]' previous models being a part of the ship.\

The '''Frost''' is an [[:Category:AI|'''AI''']] [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] that spawned during the duration of the [[Christmas Event 2022|<span style=\"color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;\">Christmas Event 2022</span>]].\
==Description==\
An extremely fast and small [[AI]] ship, it will evade most shots with ease, making it difficult to destroy.\
==Behavior==\
It follows the same pattern as most [[AI]] ships.\
\
It has a chance to spawn in 1-3 Groups every ''3'' minutes.\
\
''Note: Frosts can be force despawned if lead to the bottom or top of the map.''\
==Strategy==\
Use ships with high [[Galaxy Terminology|Alpha Damage]] like the [[Judgement]] and get into extremely close proximity with a Frost to one-shot it.\
\
Another strategy, is to use a powerful spinal attacker, preferably one with Spinals located in the center and smaller than a Battleship, like the [[Razor Wing]]. \
\
Using the spinal-based ship, '''First,''' warp to the target Frost until you catch it's attention, '''Second,''' '''''Put your ship to a standstill''''', the reason is to make the target Frost fly to you in a straight line, then '''Third''' aim your spinal reticle in the middle of the targeting box of the Frost, then shoot away!\
\
If done correctly, this method is easier than the other method above.\
==Loot==\
The Frost drops 1-2 [[Ice Shard]]s.\

"Shady_Alien_Dealer","''Current content on the page will not be finished for a while due to the last remaining recording of dialogue being deleted back in early April, my bad -ThunderJimmy''\
\
== Description ==\
\
The '''''Shady Alien Dealer''''' was one of the two [[:Category:NPC|NPC]] quest exchangers that gave away the purchasable [[Prototype X-2]] during the second re-release of the [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]] for 5 Million Credits, 1 [[Materials|Weapons Part]], and 1 [[Materials|Alien Device]]. The '''Shady Alien Dealer''' is similar to the [[Kneall Harbor Master]] as the [[:Category:NPC|NPC]] is able to give the powerful [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] in exchange for Credits and materials. Unlike the [[Kneall Harbor Master]] however, there is no official affiliation for which faction the [[Shady Alien Dealer]] represents and can only be assumed to have illegally obtained digital blueprints for the [[Prototype X-2]]. \
[[File:Shady_Alien_Dealer.png|right]]\
\
== Location ==\
Just like with the [[Shady Dealer]], the '''Shady Alien Dealer''' can be found somewhere in [[Myriad III]] through a teleporter in the [[Mega Base]] (left door of the Alien Embassy). The teleporter itself becomes active after [[Myriad III]] is upgraded to Starbase level 3.\
\
== Quest Dialogue ==\
[To Be Added Soon]\
\
== Trivia ==\
* Just like with the [[Shady Dealer]], if you attempt to scam the '''Shady Alien Dealer''' for the [[Prototype X-2]] without enough of the needed Credits and materials, you will not only be denied access to obtaining the ship, but your materials WILL be taken out of your [[Warehouse]].\
* 1 [[Materials|Weapons]] Part costs up to 1.2 Million Credits worth of [[Materials|Uranium]] (30500 to be exact), and will fill up a level 30 [[Warehouse]].\

==Description==\
The Pleb's Kodiak is a [[Pirates|Pirate]] AI Super Capital ship [[Category:Super Capital Ship]] that resembles the same shape as the [[Kraken]]. It can only be spawned in by admins.\
\
==Behavior==\
Just like the [[Punisher|Alien Punisher]], Pleb's Kodiak identifies as a \"boss\" ship and calls in other pirates when attacked or attacking other instances.\
The ship will move towards and move away from its target to create distance and thus decrease the accuracy of the target.\
==Strategy==\
Do not charge head in against a Pleb's Kodiak, even with the most powerful Super Capitals. You will be outgunned no matter what you use. Coordinate an attack with other players with the support of multiple Dreadnoughts, a full ai carrier and other ships to take down a Pleb's Kodiak. Make sure to warp 11k away when you're starting to get low, and wait for the Pleb's Kodiak to target someone else before warping back to base to heal.\

\
== Description ==\
The '''VIP Lounge''' is a lounge at the [[Mega Base]] which only people with the [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass]] can enter. As of a recent update, it is now mostly made of glass and is much more spacious than before. It also allows you to buy food and gear. These will be with you until you die, reset, or leave the game. Food and gear cost small amounts of credits.\
== Interior ==\
The interior of the VIP Lounge is very spacious on the first floor. It has a fountain (which is often recolored to be blood-red during Halloween.), and 2 vendors, as well as a few tables. The second floor has many tables, as well as glass walls and floor in some areas to allow for observation of the Mega Base.\
\
The third floor displays Staff portraits and can be accessed by any player (even Non-VIPs) through a ladder beside Terminal A of the [[Mega Base]]. This space has been used for some quest-based ships, including the recently released [[Heartbreaker]].\
== Prior to Version .58a3 ==\
Prior to V.58a3, the VIP lounge was a smaller building. It had a red and white exterior and an interior similar to the Staff-Only ship, the [[Eclipse]]. Even before this update, the VIP lounge was an admin lounge.\
== Trivia ==\
* The food vendor in the VIP Lounge sells for less than if you were to buy it from the Vending Machines.\

\
== Description ==\
'''''Shields''''' are a secondary armor in Galaxy. '''Shields''' are designed to take damage before your [[hull]] starts to be damaged. Every ship in Galaxy is equipped with varying levels of '''Shield''' health. Damage to '''Shields''' is based on the type of [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]] used when damage is being dealt. Planets and starbases also have '''Shield''', excluding the NPC [[Abandoned U.N.E Base|Abandoned U.N.E. Base]] at level 1. Shields will slowly regenerate over time.\
\
==Advantages==\
Speed helps minimize physical damage to your ship. If you can outmaneuver the enemy ship with amazing dog-fighting skills, then you won't have to worry about your '''Shields''' or [[Hull]] too much. [[Spinals|Cannons]] deal high damage to the [[Hull]] but deal low damage to '''Shields''' and travel slowly.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
'''Shields''' are weak to specific [[Spinals]]. Phasers travel quickly and deal high damage to '''Shields''' but deal low damage to hull. [[Spinals|Torpedoes]] do equal damage to '''Shields''' and [[Hull]] but require a longer time to reload and travel quite slowly. Speed always helps minimize damage to your '''Shields''' and ship overall. Keep in mind that the bigger your ship is, the more of a sitting duck you may be when your ship gets attacked by enemies.\
\
\"[[Turrets|Laser]]\" [[Turrets]] (more broadly called \"Thermal\" weaponry) also deal high damage to '''Shields''', but low damage to [[Hull]]. As the size of the [[Turrets]] increases, so does the damage dealt to '''Shields''', with [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]] dealing whopping blows with a base damage of over 100 health each.\

This team is unique in that war cannot be declared on it, meaning new players can mine safely without having to worry about being pirated by other players, and is rarely assimilated via territory.\
== Lore ==\
The '''U.N.E Starbase''' was reconditioned from the [[Abandoned U.N.E Base|Abandoned UNE Base]] due to the threat of the [[Kneall Stronghold]] getting closer to the playable area every passing second.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in version .69??\
*Received an interior remodel, made the main Starbase for the U.N.E team, 10 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] replaced with 6 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] and 4 [[Turrets|Capital Triple Lasers]], Shields increased to 100000 and Hull increased to 25000 in version .71a.\
*Gained two more terminals in version .74b[?], leading to the amount of docks being increased to 12.\
== Trivia ==\
* It is one of the only [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]] other than the [[Mega Base]] that can't be [[Assimilations|assimilated]].\
*The '''U.N.E Starbase''' can be destroyed by [[Aliens]].\
*The '''U.N.E Starbase''' has the second highest total [[Shields|Shield]] health of any [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] in the game, as well as the second highest total combined health points, only falling short of the [[Mega Base]].\
*Created by GalaxyOrigins & SpaceFighterBoss.\

"Exploits","Exploits on Galaxy have been around for a very long time, since the Alpha periods. Exploiting on Galaxy has many uses, an example can be automating the mining process to be less tedious. A lot of exploits were very powerful, some could get you 100k credits in the same amount of time it takes you to go to the washroom and back. Most of these exploits were struck down with the introduction of the Galaxy Anti-cheat, which was implemented near the start of the Gamma period of Galaxy.\
\
The Galaxypedia does not, by any means, endorse the usage of exploits on Galaxy nor encourage it. All acts of exploitation are bannable. Galaxy is widely known to have strict anti-exploit, if you choose to exploit, you do so at your own risk.\
== Spinal TP ==\
One of the most common and relevant forms of exploitation. Often seen utilized by player in a [[Scimitar]]. The mechanics of this exploit were relatively simple, with the scripts usually just teleporting the spinals to another ship in order to kill them from far away. When FilteringEnabled was introduced to the ROBLOX platform, these scripts were modified by their respective developers to instead teleport your ship very quickly to another one to give the impression that your spinals were teleporting when in reality it was the entire ship. This exploit caused a lot of issues and was increasingly hard to deal with. As it was done from a distance away, those who recorded Spinal TP happening to them rarely caught the perpetrator in their videos. A large scandal involving this was known as \"infern spinal TP\" where a infamous exploiter in the Galaxy Community maliciously created accounts to carry out the deeds. Most of these scripts have been patched, Spinal TP is rarely seen in Galaxy Gamma\
== Automining ==\
Arguably the most popular Galaxy exploit. This exploit is self-explanatory. These scripts were usually used by players to quickly obtain large sums of money, or in other cases, to cause destruction to the economy."

==Overview==\
The '''April Fool's Event 2022''' ran from about March 31<sup>st</sup>, 2022, 6PM GMT to April 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2022, 4PM GMT. The event saw the addition of several joke ships or remodels, some of which have since been disabled or removed; these included the [[MRLS Launcher Launcher]], [[Waspinator]], and [[Mega Elanis]]. A Starbase named the \"no comment,\" reportedly using the Alien team color (bright green), was also added temporarily during the beginning of the event. It reportedly was composed of several floating circles hosting large turrets, and a single-stud cube in the center. The base was not hostile towards players but could be attacked, though its tiny size made landing a hit nearly impossible. Waspinators also reportedly spawned around the base, and they could be destroyed for approximately 24k credits in combat rewards. The base, being targetable, was also theoretically lootable, but its rewards are unknown.\
\
Later on in the event, Pirate Waspinators began to spawn, which attacked players using a huge mining laser and several [[Wasp?]] AI fighters. The ship also had a considerable blast radius somewhere over 7k studs, which reportedly lead to the instant destruction of a player's MRLS Launcher Launcher.\
\
During this event, [[rcouret]] and admins were given permission to spawn a custom, massive fleet of enemy AIs and other deadly ships, eventually causing the server to be ended when an [[Eradicator]] was spawned.\

The '''Wrath''' had a design theme very similar to its former parent ship: a greyscale colour scheme and aggressively jagged shape.\
= Advantages =\
* Its speed allowed it to distract and draw fire away from [[Starbase]]s.\
*High [[Shields|Shield]] health compared to other [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] its size.\
*Somewhat high [[Hull]] heath for its size.\
*Spinals dealt balanced damage to [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]]\
= Disadvantages =\
* No [[Warp Drive]].\
*relatively low damage output.\
*No [[Turrets]]: required aiming capability with spinals.\
= Strategy =\
* Support your carrier by taking advantage of its speed on starbases and annoying any attacking ships without enough accuracy to hit you.\
*As with any other small vessels, get in larger ships' blind spots and stay away from pest-control ships such as [[Mjolnheimr]] or [[Ampharos]].\
*Make the most of all of your spinal weaponry whenever possible, as small ships are easier to aim with and you're not going to get in much damage any other way.\
= Version =\
* Added in version (?) as a custom fighter for the '''[[Stormbringer]]''' following the arrival of its 3rd model.\

<h1>Blood Ravens</h1>The '''Blood Ravens''' are a Loyalist Space Marine Chapter of unknown origins. The origins of the '''Blood Ravens''' are shrouded in mystery and are believed to be tied to a dark truth related to the Horus Heresy. This elusive Chapter has always been drawn to the pursuit of knowledge and the acquisition of ancient lore. It produces an unusually large number of Librarians among its ranks as a high proportion of Neophytes develop psychic abilities soon after their implantation with the '''Blood Ravens'''' gene-seed organs.\

== Description ==\
The '''Revenue''' is an Admin-only Ship. The ship drops no loot upon destruction. It has a damage resistance of 95% and a maximum speed of 350. Similarly to a few other special ships like the [[Black Scarab]] and [[Aurora]], this ship is shaped like a classic sea-based vessel. It features a long, pointed bow tapering back out from the center bridge. The ship also has a small set of smokestacks in the rear that connect to a single, finned thruster.\
\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Revenue's''' interior consists of a small cockpit with a pilot's seat and a small white \"screen\". The seat is gold and red.\
\
== Advantages ==\
* Super high mobility.\
* High damage resistance. (95%)\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Has no weapons.\
* Vulnerable from all sides.\
* People are more likely to go after you because they want to destroy an Admin Ship.\
* Ship is very large, similar to Dreadnoughts in size.\
== Strategy ==\
* Get other people to envy you.\
* Laugh at peasants.\
\
== Version History ==\
* Model updated in an unknown version.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* Admins are allowed to give regular players this ship on [[Galaxy Development]].\
* The '''Revenue''' is one of the rarest ships in Galaxy along with the [[Eclipse]], the [[Flying Car]], and The [[Halloween Ship]], since only admins have it.\
* '''Revenue''' is another word for income, which may correlate to the ship's golden design.\
* One of the only '''[[:Category:Admin|Admin Ships]]''' that remains in the game.\

==Description==\
The Shadowstrike is an Avellian ship that has an iconic jet-like design as well as its own custom ambience. It is similar to its playable counterpart, the Shadowstrike, in power and health. The same model is used for both ships.\
\
Unlike most AI ships of its size, it does not call other aliens to its location when in combat, which is unusual. This makes it most similar to the [[Outrider]] from the regular [[Kneall]] fleet.\
==Strategy==\
* Stay above it as its line-of-sight is not great in said position, making it unable to fire its spinals and much harder for it to fire its turrets at you.\
*Use a shield tank, as it sports a hull-shredding loadout.\
*Unlike the [[Cranefly]], it can easily be beaten by battleships and above due to its low health, but not as easily by smaller ships due to its higher speed.\
==Loot==\
\
* Drops 20 Snowflakes, 2 Plasma Batteries and 35 Alien Parts.\
== Trivia ==\
* Has a loadout of 6 Avellian Pulsewaves, a turret completely unique to it and its counterpart, the [[Shadowmane]].\
*Has its own ambience (shared with the [[Shadowmane]]), which sounds like a low-quality compilation of a train chugging, alien beeps and a long firework sound.\
**Many players find this ambience incredibly annoying.\

Delicate Chaos for the longest time has always revolved around Falloria leading fleets to take over servers, due to Falloria being an ex-captain of the Irellus Empire, a military group outside of Galaxy, the group adopted the battle cry \"THE RENT IS TOO DANG HIGH!!!\".\
\
'''Kryuvia''' is run as an absolute monarchy; there are no High Ranks or Second in Command. The leader withholds power over all aspects of the group and has the last word on everything. Due to this, the leader takes responsibility on leading the entire group rather than distributing power. Sometime in early 2019, Delicate Chaos was renamed to '''The Holy Kryuvian Empire''', which also involved votes to change/decide on many aspects of the group, including style, clothes, events and more. Members also voted to maintain the structure of an absolute monarchy, which has worked flawlessly so far as there is no HR drama or corruption.\
\
'''Kryuvian''' Ships are typically white, sometimes with yellow/gold trims. They often use floating parts as turret platforms to efficiently eliminate blindspots, and use sleek, thin designs to evade a small percentage of turret fire. (The Andromeda is the only in-game ship related to Kryuvian style)\
\
Future Kryuvian ships are canceled due to lack of motivation and Falloria receiving her tools to create them very late when she wasn't motivated as she was before.\
\
As of 07/17/2019 Falloria announced leaving galaxy, and giving everyone a chance to prove to her that they could take over the group to carry on the name.\
\
'''As of 9/11/2019 The Holy Kryuvian Empire has come to a shutdown officially by Falloria as there were no one else to carry on the group. The Discord Server has been deleted as well.'''\

The '''''Wasp?''''' is a \"[[:Category:Fighters|'''Fighter''']]\" that spawns in the [[Waspinator]].\
\
==Description==\
The '''Wasp?''' is a fighter unique to the [[Waspinator]], an April Fool's carrier that looks like a massive Wasp. There is no visible difference between this ship and regular Wasps, though this ship has stronger stats than its Miner counterpart.\
\
==Appearance==\
The '''Wasp?''' is very similar if not identical to the [[Wasp]]. Like the majority of fighters, there is little to no interior, as you just sit in a seat on top of the ship.\
\
==Advantages==\
* High health for a fighter.\
* Speedy and Agile.\
* Small build makes it hard to hit with larger [[Turrets]].\
* Has the highest range out of any turrets in the game, at 9000 Studs.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Only spawns in the [[Waspinator]].\
* Low DPS.\
==Strategy==\
* Swarm enemies as the carrier, the [[Waspinator]], has 10 of these.\
* Distract enemy turret fire as other warships attack your target.\
* Mine away Starbases at a whopping 9,000 studs away.\
==Version History==\
* Added in the [[April Fool's Event 2022]].\
==Trivia==\
*Has the longest turret range out of any playable ship in the game, at 9000 studs.\
* Extremely similar if not identical to the [[Wasp]].\
*the ? in '''Wasp?''' is part of its name, so it may look weird in the middle of sentences.\

==Interface==\
[[File:BuildMenu3.png|thumb|right|The Build Menu.]]\
\
The Build Menu is an interface that lists every ship that is able to be built under a list of ship types and sorts these ship types from the topmost being the weakest ship types, such as economical ship types and [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]], to the strongest ship type available on the bottom, which are [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships.]] Inside one of every ship type boxes are the listed ships that are available to build from that ship type.\
\
Once you click on a ship, it will show you most of its stats, its description, and how much materials it needs to be built.\
\
'''Build and Material costs of ships are sorted from the cheapest ships being on-top of the list, and the most expensive ships of a ship type being on the bottom of the list.'''\
==Limited Ships==\
[[:Category:Limited|Limited]] Ships are a special type of ships that are usually much more powerful, expensive and rare and are usually acquired from [[Quests]] in [[:Category:Events|Events]], but many Limited Ships are also able to be built, both in the Build Menu, and the '''Limited Build Menu'''.\
\
The Limited Build menu is a special menu where only Limited Ships can be built, and is found near the bottom under the Super Capital Ship type box.\
\
''The difference of Limited Ships in the Build Menu and the Limited Build Menu is that limited ships built in the regular Build Menu do not require a [[Permits|Permit]], and are usually only there during an ongoing event related to the ship that is present there. While limited ships in the Limited Build Menu '''always''' require a permit to be built, and the ships listed inside it can be built even outside their respective events.''\

\
The Kneall Outpost is an extremely large asteroid with 2 docking hubs that have many [[Punisher|Punishers]] docked around it. It can be seen from across the map due to its size.\
\
==Phase 1==\
The '''Phase 1 Kneall Outpost''' was an extremely large, unarmed starbase that is the '''tankiest''' [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] in the game with a total of 1,000,000,000 shields, making it virtually indestructible, no matter how large a sieging fleet is.\
\
The [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] had a green color on the map, and constantly spawned [[Aliens]] around it at a much faster rate, including the [[Kneall Prototype]].\
\
==Phase 2==\
The '''Phase 2 Kneall Outpost''' made the [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] no longer function as one, but rather a giant structure instead for 2 [[Quests]] ''([[THE KNEALL]] and [[Reverse Engineering]])''. It also no longer spawns [[Aliens]], nor does it make them stay near the structure.\
\
Phase 2 made the Kneall Outpost have an extremely large portal on-top of it, and has one [[Subjugator]] wreck, two [[Chimera-S]] wrecks, and two [[Judgement]] wrecks near it, suggesting a recent battle at the outpost, possibly a siege.\
==Trivia==\
*The Starbase, and entity in the game with the highest health in the game, at a total of 1,000,000,001 Health.\
*One of the only Starbases to have a different, non-functioning variant.\

== Description ==\
The '''Aurora''' was created to be a luxury space yacht. It is fairly slow compared to the [[Flying Car]] and [[Revenue]], but is still quite fast relative to ships of its size.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Aurora''' features:\
* A gaming lounge.\
* 3 Guest bedrooms & one personal bedroom. Each with their own bathrooms.\
* A Grand Ballroom.\
* State of the art furniture.\
* A helipad.\
== Advantages ==\
* 95% Damage Resistance.\
* High health pool.\
*<s>The best ship interior in the entire game.</s>\
*One of the most fancy ships.\
*Good for spectating battles with the high damage resistance.\
*Somewhat small ships like [[Gryphon|Gryphons]] can land on the helipad when the '''Aurora''' is sitting still.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No [[Turrets]].\
* Somewhat slow for an [[:Category:Admin|'''Admin Ship''']].\
* Easy to hit due to its large size.\
== Strategy ==\
* There is no real strategy to using this ship; those flying it cannot fight back, so the only options are to tank damage with your 95% damage resistance or retreat. In the meantime:\
** Make everyone jealous you have a \"Ship\" in Galaxy.\
** Go on a luxury space cruise.\
** Throw a party.\
== Version History ==\
* Removed along with most of the [[:Category:Admin|'''Admin Ships''']] in version .62a1.\
* Re-added in version .68e???\
* Removed again in unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* Most unknown ship--only 2 players (Uglycar and Rekuri) own it and it was missing/not allowed on the Wiki for a while.\
* '''[[Galaxy Staff|Admins]]''' were allowed to give regular players this ship on [[Galaxy Development]].\
* Was owned by a normal player for a limited time.\

The '''Patriotic Phantom''' was a limited ship that is part of the 2019 July 4th event. It has a red, white, and blue theme instead of the color scheme of the regular [[Phantom]].\
\
==Interior==\
The '''Patriotic Phantom''' had the same interior as a regular phantom, but with different colored walls.\
\
==Advantages==\
* Well-defended underbelly.\
* Somewhat fast.\
* Powerful against Shields.\

==Disadvantages==\
* Exactly the same as a regular Phantom, except for the colors.\
* Prime target for Pirates.\
* Low Hull damage.\
* Once you lose this ship you can't get it back after the event ends.\
\
==Strategy==\
*Use the shield-based firepower to burn through enemy [[Shields]], then call in support to finish them off.\
*Pairs well with [[:Category:Hull breaker|Hull-breaker]] ships which can make up for its lacking anti-[[Hull]] firepower.\
\
==Version History==\
*Added in version .65b on July 5th as part of the 2019 Fourth of July event.\
*Removed along with a plethora of other Fourth of July-themed Limited ships in an unknown version.\

The '''Xenophile''' was one of the first [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to be added to the game, along with the [[Fury]]. It carries two small [[Spinals|Phasers]] and has a top speed of 300.

* Work with other fighters to take down ships by staying in the enemy's blind spots.\
* Avoid ships with high-accuracy or high rate-of-fire turrets (Gatlings), as they can deal significant damage to fighters and will destroy them if given the chance.\
* Use your insane speed to distract weapon fire while others rake down the target.\

* Remodeled in version ??\
\

==Description==\
The '''''Cranefly''''' is an [[Avellian]] ship that has a unique design, somewhat resembling the real-life [[wikipedia:Crane_fly|Crane fly]] in the way that its thin body leads on to a long snout. It is similar to its playable counterpart, the [[Solstice]], in power and health. The same model is used for both ships.\
\
Just like the [[Punisher]], it will call all other aliens to its location when under attack by a player or another AI ship, making it particularly difficult to deal with.\
==Strategy==\
* A singular '''''Cranefly''''' can be beaten by mere frigates due to its slow turnspeed and inaccurate armament.\
*Try to use a shield-heavy ship against it (such as the [[Judgement]]) as the '''''Cranefly''''' sports a hull-shredding loadout, or use a speedy swarm of smaller ships as to not get hit at all.\
* Recommended not to attack alone if a number of other [[:Category:Alien|Aliens]] are in the server.\
**Alternatively, lure to a [[Starbase]] with a fast ship and draw their fire while the base's weaponry shreds the fleet. \
== Loot ==\
\
* Drops 30 Snowflakes.\
== Trivia ==\
* One of the only NPC Avellian (and by extent Slarfie) ships in the game, the others being the [[Scout]], the [[Shadowstrike]] and the [[Adversary]], all introduced in the same event.\

==Description==\
The '''Frenzy''' is a \"stealth\" variant of the [[Fury]]. It carries four [[Spinals|Small Phasers]], slightly less hull than its sister [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]], and more speed. However, the '''Frenzy''' is a slippery [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]], meaning it is very hard to control. It won't go in a straight line if you turn it too hard. People use it in swarms a lot, and it is hard to take out if it manages to get into a blind spot on your ship. It is carried on the [[Rhino]].\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Frenzy'''<nowiki/>'s interior is the exact same as the [[Fury|Fury's]] interior. It is entered through the cockpit window and has a seat behind a steering column.\
==Advantages==\
* Because of the speed, you can distract bases effectively.\
* [[Spinals|Phasers]] can easily wear down enemy [[Shields]], allowing anti-hull [[ships]] to deal higher damage.\
* Higher speed than a fury.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Low health.\
* High speed can make it hard to control.\
* Awkward handling.\
==Strategy==\
* If you're in a faction with 4+ members, use the frenzy to take down bigger [[ships]].\
* Stay in the blindspot of enemy [[ships]] to escape being damaged.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a remodel sometime during version .61.\
* Received a remodel in version .66b\
== Trivia ==\
* Used to have a [[Warp Drive]].\
* Used to randomly spawn in level 3 [[Starbase]]s.\
*[[Hevnetier]] used to spawn this fighter as a random fighter, it lost it's feature in version .64f.\

== Description ==\
The '''Defiance '''is decently fast [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]] that deals very high damage with its [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]].\
== Appearance ==\
The interior to the Defiance includes a small pilot seat with a small screen in front of it.\
== Advantages ==\
* High damage output for its class.\
* Fast, maneuverable and small.\
* No blind spots.\
* The [[Turrets]] are in a good position to simultaneously fire with [[Spinals]].\
* Strong against shields for its class.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Needs good [[Spinals|Spinal]] aim to do hull damage.\
* Slow for a Destroyer, as slow as many battlecruisers.\
* Pilot must rely on spinals to deal substantial hull damage\
== Strategy ==\
* Used best to exploit the blind spots of larger and less mobile ships in order to deal the most damage without dying.\
* Use this for diving weak targets, as the [[Spinals|Cannons]] easily shred hull.\
* The '''Defiance''' is also useful for hunting [[Aliens]] with its high-accuracy [[Turrets]].\
== Version History ==\
* Added in update .65a6.\
* Max Hull reduced from 600 to 500, Turn speed reduced from .6 to .55, Cannon barrels reduced from 5 to 3 in version .65b\
== Trivia ==\
* It has a light blue trail like the [[Valiant]].\
*Its model resembles the Hercules from Star Conflict\

\
== Description ==\
The Macross is a ship with a futuristic tractor-like appearance, equipped with a powerful array of [[Spinal Weaponry|Phasers]] for its size; as well as decent durability. It is mostly gray in color, with blue engines and a [[United Nations of Earth|U.N.E.]] flag on the rear behind the seat. A [[Turrets|Tiny Cannon]] sits on the top of the bow of the ship.\
\
== Advantages ==\
*Powerful Phaser spinal array allows this ship to melt [[Shields|shielding]].\
*High maneuverability combined with durability allows this ship to be a difficult target to destroy, even with point-defense turrets.\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
*[[:Category:Limited|Limited]] classification along with expense means this ship is a valuable target in the heat of any battle.\
*Poor [[Hull]] damage output.\
\
== Strategy ==\
*Treat this ship like the shield breaker counterpart to the [[Abyss]], and use it to heavily damage the shielding of ships larger than you that often have turrets that are not accurate enough to reliably hit you.\
*Do not use this ship alone, as even though it is very maneuverable with a decent health pool for a Frigate; it can still easily be destroyed.\
\
== Version History ==\
*Added in version .75a12.\
\
== Trivia ==\
*Has a unique appearance that resembles a space-faring tractor.\

"Alliances","''Some information on this page may be inaccurate due to recent updates to the Alliance system. Such information is denoted with game-default alliances known as Alpha, Beta..'\
{{Image Infobox\
|title1=Alliance Menus\
}}An '''Alliance''' is an in-game mechanic involving one or more [[Player Factions]].\
== Description ==\
'''Alliances''' provide a safety net for factions unwilling to go to war. If a faction that is part of an alliance faces a war declaration, all other allied factions not allied with the warring faction will also go to war with the original faction that declared war. Sometimes alliances are used to make a siege easier, as two factions with a lot of [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] could easily destroy a [[Starbase]].\
\
People also often make '''alliances''' between trading factions or factions lead by their friends. You cannot declare war on someone who you are allied with, so a terminated alliance can be a warning sign for incoming wars. (?)\
\
When a faction wars another faction, the attacking faction will automatically declare war against all of the defending faction's allies. However, if the defending faction has the same ally as the attacking faction, they will not go to war, but instead, the alliance is canceled out. Allying them shortly after is still possible. (?)\
\
== Uses ==\
* You can teleport to an allied faction's Starbases or Planets via the teleport menu. However, you are not able to spawn your own ships in allied faction structures.\
* You cannot assimilate another team's Starbases or take their territory if you are allied.\
* Typically, your teams will work together, even as one team. However, this is not always the case.\
* Docked ships at allied Starbases/Planets will allow you to repair your ship just as it would at your own Starbase/Planet (?)\
\
==Version History==\
*Alliances were disabled in version .70c due to a planned re-write of the general diplomacy system\
*Alliances were re-enabled in version .73e with basic functionality; faction leaders could join three preset alliances (\"Alpha,\" \"Beta,\" or \"Gamma\"), and other factions could send a request to the founding faction to join those alliances. \

The '''Herald''' is literally a Harbinger with more health (and medium phasers instead of small phasers).\
==Interior ==\
The interior is the same as the [[Harbinger]], obviously.\
==Advantages ==\
*Able to effectively engage in combat with both large and small ships due to its variety of weapons.\
*Great firepower when [[Spinals]] are used to best ability.\
*Massive health compared to most [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]], at a whopping 6000 total health.\
*Very powerful when paired with the Harbingers.\
==Disadvantages ==\
*No [[Warp Drive]], meaning it must be released and deployed by the carrier pilot close to the intended target.\
*Slower and less maneuverable than most [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Low turn speed for a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]].\
*Only one spawned in the Prometheus at the time.\
==Strategy ==\
*Use the same strategies as the [[Harbinger]].\
==Version History ==\
*Added in an unknown version, replacing one of the Harbingers in the [[Prometheus]] (only revealed in-game).\
*Shields/Hull increased from 2800 to 3000, 4 Small Phasers changed to 4 Medium Phasers in version .74b14 (only revealed in-game).\
*Replaced by another Harbinger in version .75a5, this ship can not be found on any ship anymore.\

* Good firepower for a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]]. (Higher than some [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyers]]).\
* Good durability.\
* Has two weapon types, allowing it to be effective no matter the situation.\
* Easy to control since it moves slow enough for the pilot to react.\

* Can be out-ranged easily.\
* Larger than most [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* Can only be found on an extremely rare ship, the Ghoul Nyx.\
== Strategy ==\

== Trivia ==\
* [[Halloween Event 2017|Halloween Event]] re-skin of the [[Nixesion]].\

* These are super rare, maybe going months before seeing any form of combat.\
* They still use the old [[Nixesion]] model.\

\
==Description==\
The '''Maple Syrup Launcher''' is a Canadian-themed Battlecruiser added during the second part of the 2021 Fourth of July Event. It is based on the [[MRLS Launcher]], but features a red and white color scheme and some adjusted stats.\
\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Maple Syrup Launcher''' is simple and largely identical to its regular counterpart, featuring only a pilot's seat and a team-colored dashboard.\
\
==Advantages==\
*Can deal massive amounts of hull damage with its 8 small torpedoes.\
*Has more health, more maneuverability, more torpedoes, and more powerful turrets than its counterpart.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
*Relatively slow and unwieldy for a Battlecruiser, even with its buffed stats.\
*The limited nature of this ship, as well as its bright colors, can make it a prime target.\
*Its DPS relies heavily on its [[Spinals]]. Since torpedoes are relatively slow, this makes hitting fast targets difficult.\
\
==Strategy==\
*Use this ship against large, slow targets or at close range to maximize its damage output.\
*Support ships like the [[Ampharos]] with high-accuracy turrets can be vital to fend off smaller enemy ships that are hard to hit with torpedoes.\
\
==Version History==\
*No logged changes?\

==Description==\
The '''Patriotic Devastation''' is a reskinned [[Devastation]] added during the 2021 Fourth of July Event. It features improved firepower and health over its regular counterpart, as well as a red, white, and blue color scheme. Its model is largely identical to that of the original Devastation, featuring the same eagle logo and team-colored background.\
\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Patriotic Devastation''' is similar to that of the regular Devastation, but with a patriotic color scheme.\
\
==Advantages==\
*Has more health, maneuverability, and firepower than its non-limited counterpart.\
*Small and Medium turrets allow for decent defense against smaller ships.\
*Dual-barrel Phasers give it high shield damage and some redundancy if spinals miss.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
*Hull damage is limited due to the comparatively weak output of its gatling cannons.\
*The limited nature of this ship makes it more of a target.\
\
==Strategy==\
*Utilize the mainly shield-focused firepower to burn the shields of enemy ships.\
*Pair up with a [[:Category:Hull breaker|Hull-breaker]] to compensate for the weak hull damage.\
\
==Version History==\
*Recolored in version .72e4\

None.\
==Advantages==\
* High maneuverability.\
*High health pool for a battlecruiser\
*Unique [[Turrets|Karaclaves]] deal mainly shield damage\
*Thin body allows it to speedtank most turrets\
==Disadvantages==\
* Relies on Medium Cannon spinals for Hull Damage.\
*Moderate portion of its HP in shields, making it somewhat susceptible to shield breakers like the [[Zeus]] or [[Sagittarius]]\
*Difficult to get out of due to the small cockpit, often leading to the pilot getting stuck.\
==Strategy==\
* The Valkerac is just a tankier [[Zhen]] with less speed and cargohold\

The '''''Foxfire '''''is a small and fast '''[[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]]''' found on the [[Nimitz]].\
\
== Description ==\
The '''Foxfire''' is a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] added to the [[Nimitz]]. It is a small sleek ship that, alongside it's high top speed, has a relatively easy time dodging enemy fire.\
==Appearance==\
The Foxfire is a fighter with a relatively large size. It is a flat ship that has a similar shape to the [[Spectre]], featuring 3 of its spinal barrels on the front, and the text '''\"FOXFIRE\"''' on its side.\
\
The Interior of the '''Foxfire''' is nothing more than a small cockpit containing the pilot's seat.\
==Advantages==\
*Can inflict high damage to [[Shields]].\
*High Top Speed and small size makes it difficult to hit.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Extremely low health and non-existent Damage Resistance of 0%.\
*Little to no [[Hull]] damage.\
==Strategy==\
*Focus on [[Shields|Shielded]] ships to deal as much damage as possible.\
*This Fighter is best used in a swarm. Attack the enemy with high speed and with its high shield damage, a swarm will bring enemy ships to Hull quickly.\
*Utilize drifting and hit-and-run tactic to survive as long as possible while dealing the maximum amount of damage.\
*Avoid attacking any ship that can take down fighters easily, such as the Ampharos or the Mjolheimr.\
==Version History==\
*Removed from the Nimitz in an unknown version.\
*Nimitz remodel reverted, making this ship playable again in an unknown version.\
==Trivia==\
*One of the three [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to replace the [[Interceptor]]s that were previously spawned on the [[Nimitz]].\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Typhoon''' is a dedicated shield breaker that also has some cannons available on the side, much like its parent ship. It is also designed to be the polar opposite of the [[Blitz]], a fighter carried aboard the [[Borealis]], a carrier which is (not coincidentally) the opposite of the '''Stormbringer'''.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Typhoon'''<nowiki/>'s appearance is similarly styled to that of its parent ship, sporting a mostly greyscale colour scheme with neon orange accents. As with many smaller ships in the game, it bears a resemblance to a real-life plane, specifically a fighter jet. There is not much in the way of an interior. A simplistic seat inside a pass-through cockpit windshield on the stern of the ship.\
== Advantages ==\
* Capable of dealing both hull and shield damage, due to it having both cannons and phasers, however it boasts far more phasers than cannons.\
* Low spinal cooldown.\
*Very high firepower.\
* 6 of these fighters are carried on each '''Stormbringer,''' providing capacity for [[Fighter Swarming|fighter swarms]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No turrets.\
* Purely [[Spinal Weaponry|spinal]]-based weaponry requires good aim to deal any damage at all.\
* Below average health which allows them to be swept aside quicker.\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Typhoon''' replaced the '''[[Wrath]]''' upon its addition in the 3rd remodel of the '''Stormbringer''', the '''Wrath''' belonging to the 2nd.\
* A storm becomes a Typhoon if it becomes powerful enough, which explains the name of the fighter.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in version (?), replacing the '''Wrath''' as the '''Stormbringer's''' unique fighter following the latter's 3rd remodel.\
* Health increased (250/250 -> 300/300) .75a12\

The Prototype  X-2 is a heavily nerfed, and highly agile, replica of the [[:Category:Super Capital Ship]] [[Prototype X-2]]. \
\
It can be obtained by paying 200,000 credits to the Alien quest giver, found by accessing a red teleporter pad on the top of the [[Mega Base]]. \
==Interior==\
The interior is identical to that of the [[Prototype X-2]], with a metal door leading to a seat with a screen with \"WELCOME, USER\" written on it.\
==Advantages==\
*Balanced weaponry\
*Good, if not above average, health for a battleship\
*Good shield breaking capabilities\
*Damage output is surprisingly high at 450+ DPS combined.\
*Great, if not ridiculous, turn rate.\
*High speed\
==Disadvantages==\
*No hull-breaking turrets\
*Lasers have a long reload time\
*Speed reduces accuracy\
* Very expensive at 200k credits; considered by most buyers to be a waste of money.\
*Limited, meaning it cannot be regained once lost.\
== Version History ==\
* Was removed along with [[Prototype X/1]] in version .75a10. Players who owned this ship and/or the X/1 was refunded.\
== Strategy==\
*Use in swarms against bigger ships; got enough health and firepower to solo the [[Punisher]]\
*Attack from underneath the enemy for shield breaking, and then attack head-on when opponent is hulled.\
* Don't engage in any boss like scenarios since that won't end well due to its low health.\
==Trivia==\
*The name of the ship is \"Prototype  X-2\" With two spaces.\
*This version of the X-2 is considered a battleship.\
*The first person to lose this ship was azAZ458990 who lost it to seehyadued52's (real) Prototype X-2.\
*Similar to other quest ships for April Fools', the quest required a large amount of credits at 2,000,000, but only costed 200,000 credits. However, it would take the 2,000,000 credits if the player had them.\
*Quest giver's location for it is assumed to be (after teleporting from the Mega Base) in the [[Kneall Stronghold]].\
* Presumed to be a late April Fools' Day ship as a counterpart to the [[Prototype X/1]]\

The Kneall are a vicious, warlike alien race and the ones behind the NPC alien ships we encounter in-game such as the [[Punisher]] or [[Decimator]].\
\
They are the race responsible for the current war with the [[United Nations of Earth|U.N.E]] and the attempts to destroy [[Mega Base]]. \

A past event called the [[Kneall Event]] features this race's advancing invasion towards [[United Nations of Earth|U.N.E]].\

''More information about their ships can be found at the page [[Aliens]].''\
__NOTOC__\
[[Category:Galaxy Lore]]\
[[Category:Alien]]\
[[Category:AI]]\
\
== Lore ==\
The Kneall are a hostile type 2 civilization that have taken control of roughly a third of the Milky Way galaxy. The Kneall first reached space outside their solar system during the human industrial revolution between the 1800's and 1900's. Over the past thousand years, developing races across the Milky Way have been exterminated by the growing Kneall armada and dozens of planets have been converted into factories for their war machines. In recent years, the increased human activity in space outside their own solar system, paired with their rapid development in new technologies, has led to frequent interactions with these hostile aliens. Today, human and Kneall forces regularly clash in open war as the expansion of human influence threatens Kneall supremacy. \
\
As a side note, the Kneall have a much larger and stronger navy than human factions like the UNE and Osiris Legion. Humans have managed to fight back because of their defense pact with the Slarfie, persistence, and their strategic adaptability when under pressure. The Kneall armada is also rarely seen outside of Kneall space. Securing so much territory for their empire requires much of their navy to be spread thin across their empire, busy policing and fortifying their own systems to ensure they aren't vulnerable to attack. This leaves only small strike fleets for the Kneall to use for offensive purposes. (SHORTENED VERSION: Kneall should kill humans ez but they can't or else the game wouldn't exist so humans have plot armor lol)\
\
The Kneall empire is not to be underestimated."

The '''''Bruiser''''' is an [[:Category:Alien|'''Alien''']] [[:Category:AI|AI]] ship roughly equivalent to a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
\
==Description==\
The '''Bruiser''' is an Alien AI ship first added as a part of the [[Kneall]] fleet in the Alien AI update, along with a few others like the [[Outrider]] and [[Kneall Scout|Scout]]. It is the [[Aliens|Alien]] equivalent of a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
==Behavior==\
It will stay 500–1000 away from its target, turning around at the maximum distance and heading back towards the target ship. This is oddly close for an [[:Category:Alien|'''Alien''']], as it makes it an easy target to hit with [[spinals]] and [[turrets]].\
==Strategy==\
*Its health is primarily [[Shields|shield-based]], so shield-breaking ships with laser turrets or phaser spinals are particularly effective. \
*Watch out for its spinals, as it can fire them backwards.\
*If using a small ship try to get above it so its spinals and turrets cannot hit you.\
*You can also use an AA/[[:Category:Support Ship|Support]] ship to easily defeat it.\
==Loot==\
*Bruiser wrecks give 120 Alien Parts and 1 [[Bruiser Part]].\
==Trivia==\
* A crashed bruiser can be seen on Myriad III.\
* Before the update of .67c the alien bruiser could only be spawned with a quest at Frion's Lucifer Station. Now it spawns naturally along with other Alien enemy ships like the Outrider.\
*Only 3 Bruisers can be spawned in a server at any time.\
*One of the only ships to have intentionally backwards-firing spinals.\

==Description==\
The '''Christmas Tree''' is a ship designed after its namesake; the \"base\" of the tree acts as the docking point and entry, while the rest of the ship is shaped out of a snow-covered Christmas tree with red ornaments and a star on the \"top.\"\
==Interior==\
The '''Christmas Tree''' has a simple interior: The back the ship teleports pilots to a central wooden room, which has a glowing red teleporter pad, a log that acts as the pilot's seat, and a sign reading \"Merry Christmas\" in green and yellow letters.\
==Advantages==\
*Has a great deal of health for a Battlecruiser.\
*Has extremely powerful hull spinals, making it ideal against hulled based ships such as the [[Armageddon]].\
*Very fast, making it hard to hit in some cases.\
==Disadvantages==\
*A limited ship making it a target for other players.\
*Only armed with one set of torpedoes, limiting its offensive capabilities.\
*The reload speed puts this ship at a disadvantage.\
*Bulky model makes it easier to hit.\
==Strategy==\
==Version History==\
*In .69a1, the spinal pattern was changed and the cannons were changed to torpedoes. The torpedoes are now the ornaments on the ship, they also now shoot forward. \
*In .69a1, it was added to the [[Christmas Event 2021|2021 Christmas Event]] as a Battlecruiser.\
==Trivia==\
* There is another Christmas Tree under the themed starbases. Maybe they shoot torpedoes too!\
* Plays quiet, Christmas-themed background music when spawned.\

The '''Nova''' is a powerful [[Spinals|Spinal]]-based [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]]. The spinals that are fired from this ship come from the left and right wings. It is mostly flat in shape, which can make it hard to hit.\

The interior is nothing more than a simple cockpit containing the pilot's seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* High [[Spinals|Spinal]] Firepower.\
* Good maneuverability.\
* Has decent health.\
* High damage to [[Shields]] due to its laser arsenal.\
* A good ship to support a fleet.\

* Low [[Hull]] damage, with only the [[Spinals|Medium Cannon]] against it.\
* Very vulnerable blindspots.\
* Relatively low health.\
* Slightly slower than other ships of its class.\

* Make sure to hit with all [[Spinals]].\
* Go in large ship's blind spots and harass them with your [[Turrets|Lasers]].\
== Version History ==\
* Received a remodel in version .67e?\
== Trivia ==\
* The original model had a large cannon on its back, which may have made new players think it was much more powerful than it actually was.\
* When some players buy it and look at it, it looks very armed.\

== Description ==\
Very few people have seen a '''Chad Swarmer''' and lived to tell the tale. The '''Chad Swarmer''' is the pinnacle of Kneall engineering, these incredibly powerful machines act as elite units in the Kneall armada. Their large ‘stompers’ allow them to instill fear on all opposing ground forces; while their powerful Kneall heavy quantum rail lasers are able to penetrate even the thickest of armors.\
\
Approach with extreme caution.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior is composed of an Alien [[Swarmer]] protection bubble capable of deflecting the strongest of weapons. Attempting to breach the bubble is nearly impossible, and will always result in failure.\
== Advantages ==\
* Incredibly fast, it is the fastest a ship can fly because of restrictions.\
* The second tankiest ship in the game, right behind the [[Malice]].\
* The only Chad ship in the game.\
* The Chad Swarmer's menacing look is enough to scare anyone, even the strongest of [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]].\
* Starbases and NPCs won't attack admin ships.\
* Admins can add admin ships to themselves whenever they want, so they are pretty much free.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No weapons.\
== Strategy ==\
* Attack your opponents with your menacing presence.\
* Use the extreme shield and speed to tank enemy fire or starbases, even at point-blank range!\
== Version History ==\
* Shield changed from ? to 25,000\
== Trivia ==\
* It's an Alien [[Swarmer]] model with legs.\
*'''Chad Swarmer''' contains a shield system so advanced it could probably survive the heat death of the universe.\
*Chad vibes\
*The [[Obliterator]] has a photo of the '''Chad Swarmer''' in the interior.\
*The Galaxy Info bot in the Discord has the '''Chad Swarmer''' as his profile.\

The '''2019 Halloween Event''' started on Wednesday, October 15, and was presumed to run until November 15. This update fell under the larger version .66b and added several new ships and Halloween-themed decorations to the game.\
\
Unlike past events, this year's featured multiple ships that were completely unique, rather than being reskins of existing models (with the exception of Plagued Warship, which is essentially a reskinned [[Katana]] model). These included the [[Astaroth|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Astaroth</span>]], [[Demon|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Demon</span>]], [[Hallow|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Hallow</span>]], [[Plagued Warship|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Plagued Warship</span>]], [[Aberrant|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Aberrant</span>]], [[Abaddon|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Abaddon</span>]], [[Azreal|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Azreal</span>]], [[Lucifer|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Lucifer</span>]], and the previously hidden event quest ship [[Erebus|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Erebus</span>]].\
\
Swarmers and Punishers, as well as their lasers, were recolored to deep orange. Their loot was increased, especially in that Swarmers drop 75 Uranium, and Punishers drop 500–750.\
\
The [[Halloween Mega Base|Mega Base]] received one of the most ambitious Halloween reskins yet, and Starbases received an impressive cosmetic interior buff. This included pumpkins, bats, streamers, text on the interior displays of the starbase, and even a graveyard in the fighter hangar.\
\
It is also the first Halloween event to not have a boss, and the first not to use special Pumpkin items for ship construction.\

The '''Kneall Prototype''' is a Kneall fleet ship added in the recent Alien AI update, along with a few others (like the [[Kneall Bruiser|Bruiser]] and [[Kneall Outrider|Outrider]]).\
== Behavior ==\
Unlike other Kneall [[Ships]], the '''Kneall Prototype '''will maneuver to a range of 0-500 studs away from its target. It is able to fight more effectively with this closer range allowing it to usually turn its side to the enemy.  \
== Strategy ==\
*Use a [[Viper]] or a similar [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] to distract the [[Turrets]] while Dreadnoughts and Battleships dish out heavy damage.\
*Warp to a distance after destroying this ship, as it has a very large and damaging death explosion.\

*? Alien Parts + 50 Plasma Batteries.\
*You can only loot up to 25 plasma batteries per run from a Kneall Prototype wreck.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* The ship has a similar model to the [[Prototype X-2]] but it is slightly different with numerous antennas and being smaller.\
* Some people describe this as a weaker Prototype X-2 but, in fact, the '''Kneall Prototype''''s DPS is much higherthan Prototype X-2's DPS.\
* The Kneall Subcannon has poor LoS.\
* You used to be able to pilot this in [[Galaxy Development]].\

The '''yname''' is a troll ship, named after a [[Galaxy Staff|Galaxy Developer]]; of which its only purpose is to confuse/annoy people, and possibly destroy unsuspecting victims with the explosion radius if it is destroyed.\
==Appearance==\
The ship has the appearance of a monkey, stood on all fours with its tail angled almost straight up. The pilot seat is located on the top of the ship, and there is no interior.\
==Advantages==\
*Has very high maneuverability.\
*Fast freighter\
*Was once Free\
==Disadvantages==\
*The ship has no armament of any kind whatsoever.\
*Now a limited ship\
==Strategy==\
*Use the durability and maneuverability of this ship to be a distraction in battle.\
*Extremely good for taking the aggro of Bosses and Bases. As long as you maintain a decent distance and keep your speed at max, it is nigh impossible for anything to destroy this ship.\
*Feel free to use this ship recklessly despite being a limited. It is almost impossible to kill a yname flown by a decent pilot.\
==Version History==\
*Explosion radius reduced from 600 to 100 in version .75a11.\
*Class changed to Frieghter .75a12\
*Cargo hold changed to 2005 .75a12\
*Nerfed (Unknown version probably .75a12)\
==Trivia==\
*This ship is similar in nature to an [[:Category:Admin|Admin-class]] ship, but it doesn't have as much resistance; and it has a much larger explosion radius.\
*It was made available for 1 day\
*Before it's explosion radius was nerfed, it's nuke caused the loss of ships like the [[United States of Razor]], and the [[Nightmare]].\
*There was a bug where a Class D Permit was accidentally added to yname's cost for a short period. A few players fell victim to this and lost a million credits as a result.\

"Assimilations","==Overview==\
An ''Assimilation'' occurs when one faction's home territory becomes occupied by another [[Factions|Faction's]] territory. The faction that has lost their territory will be \"Assimilated\" into the other faction, and all [[Starbase|Starbases]] owned by the assimilated [[Factions|Faction]] will fall under the control of the ''assimilating'' [[Factions|Faction]]. As such, the assimilated [[Starbase]] will adopt that [[Factions|Faction]]'s team color. Assimilation is one of the main ways factions take control of planets or other NPC bases (except [[Mega Base]]). The more power your [[Starbase]] has, the faster it will gain territory. To gain power you can dump ore at your base or destroy a ship or a base, which can give a significant amount of power depending on the class or level of the ship or base. Assimilation is an irreversible process, much like faction destruction, but assimilated factions ''can'' be assimilated a second time by ''other'' factions. When a planet/starbase is assimilated, a text colored the same color as the faction that assimilated it that says \"[faction name] has [taken a [planet/base] from [faction name]/been assimilated into [faction name]\" will appear on the chat.\
\
Planets like Frion I can also be assimilated by \"destroying\" them, but only if they are owned by another faction with which yours is at war. Because planets cannot be physically destroyed, any planet that has its shield and hull fully depleted will simply become part of the territory of the faction that dealt the final blow. If a planet has enough power, it can also help you assimilate other factions. Planets were previously able to be assimilated by simply attacking it as part of the neutral faction, but this was changed in version .70c to be only taken over by NPC ships (e.g. [[Swarmer]]), territory, and ship nukes (e.g. [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]]).\
\
==Strategy==\
Assimilation relies on factions gaining power to increase their territory. Some methods for increasing power include:\
*'''Dumping or transferring ore in your own base.'''\
*'''Destroying enemy ships'''\
*'''Using a freighter with a large cargo hold and buying from your base and selling it to your nearest neighbor. (This strategy only works when you are not at war with said faction, and when the nearby base has enough credits to pay for the sold ore).'''\

== Description ==\
The '''Revenge''' is Kneall limited spinal-based cruiser armed with 8 small cannons and 4 medium phasers from part 2 of the [[Halloween Event 2020|Halloween 2020]] Event.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Revenge '''has a very detailed interior featuring a cockpit and a bedroom. Due to its small size, the player can only properly observe it in first person. It is a combination of green and grey, with a few pumpkins placed around. The cockpit has a medical kit, some candles, and a skull with a blue flame burning in one eye-socket, supposedly referencing the Undertale character Sans.\
== Advantages ==\
* Extremely powerful spinals for a cruiser.\
* High speed for a cruiser.\
* High shield for a cruiser.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Bad hull points for its price.\
* You needed to have kept 100 Alien Parts before its respective event started.\
* No turrets.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use its speed and powerful spinals to drift around your enemies.\
* Only use this if you sure that you won't lose it as its a limited ship with low health.\
*Access enemy blindspots, and deal tons of damage from there.\
== Version History ==\
* No logged changes.\
== Trivia ==\
* To acquire the '''Revenge''', you had to use the alien rift and teleport to the Kneall production facility.\
* The only way to obtain Alien Parts to make this ship during the event was to trade with other players, as they were not dropped by event enemies.\
*There used to be a framed image of ex-developer EvilPleeber119's avatar inside this ship, but it has since been removed. The empty frame can still be seen on the wall to the right of the bed.\
* One of the few playable alien ships in game.\

"Loyalty","'''''Loyalty''''' affects the number of [[Credits]] you earn when mining and the amount of damage that you do. The time needed to gain a certain '''Loyalty''' can be calculated with the following formula:\
\
\
\
y=45x(x-1)-20<p style=\"text-align:left;\">X = the amount of '''Loyalty'''</p><p style=\"text-align:left;\">Y = the time needed to reach \"x\" '''Loyalty''' (in seconds)</p>[[File:Loyalty.png|thumb|Loyalty display|link=https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/File:Loyalty.png]]With the [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass]], you start with 3% '''Loyalty'''. Loyalty Boost also takes effect.\
During [[Endgame]], Loyalty is gained 150% faster, meaning each level takes 2/3<sup>rds</sup> as long to reach. Being in combat may also affect loyalty gain, but such information is unverified.\
\
'''Loyalty''' saves even when you leave, as long as you join the same faction as before.\
\
Either the formula above is incorrect or the loyalty gain in a vip server is different, as testing was done and the times are incorrect.\

<h1> Trivia </h1>\
*It would take approximately '''5 days, 3 hours, 44 minutes, 40 seconds''' to reach a Loyalty of 100% (without endgame) before the cap was added.\
*As of version .64e, '''Loyalty''' was capped at 30%. New records can't be set anymore. This cap was raised to 33% in version .71c.\
*It would take approximately''' 13 hours, 11 minutes, 40 seconds''' to reach a maximum Loyalty of 33%  without endgame.\
*As of version .61h, '''Loyalty''' increases '''25% faster''' than before.\
*As of version .68a, '''Loyalty''' and Starbase level requirements to spawn certain ships have been lowered.\
*The \"Loyalty Saving Update\" was done in response to the then-famous \"GUI glitch,\" which made it impossible to interact with any [[Starbase]] or ship GUI screens, rendering the game nearly unplayable for those that it befell. The only known way to fix it was to rejoin the game, which previously meant all '''Loyalty''' was lost. This glitch has now been patched.\
*Loyalty is no longer a ship spawning requirement .76c1\

"Gámér_Gamer","{{RemovedShip}}\
\
== Description ==\
'''Gámér Gamer''' was the Quest NPC for the [[Christmas Event 2018]]. He gave players [[Quests|Quest]] #14 - \"Rennovator Innevator.\" '''Gámér''' was seen working on the ice around a frozen ship. He was wearing a rather high-tech spacesuit to protect him from [[Aqueous II|Aqueous]]'s freezing temperatures. He was subsequently removed from the game with the end of the Christmas Event.\
[[File:GamerGamer.png|centre|thumb|800x800px]]\
\
== Location ==\
'''Gámér Gamer''' was found on top of the planet [[Aqueous II]] next to a giant ice crystal with a rusted ship inside. Nearby is a blue tent-like structure with a [[Spinals|Torpedo]] inside.\
\

The '''''Preos Adult''''' is the final stage of the [[Preos Egg]]'s evolution questline, added in the [[:Category:Halloween 2021|Halloween Event 2021]]. It resembles the [[Plagued Preos Adult]] boss, which was required to be killed in order to make this ship.\
==Description==\
The '''''Preos Adult''''' is a dreadnought that is the largest of the playable Preos ships. Being an evolution of the younger stages of the ship, it shares design traits and turrets with all of them.\
==Interior==\
The interior is identical to the interiors of the previous Preos ships: a purple sphere with a holographic teleporter and seat.\
==Advantages==\
*High health.\
*Very high damage to hull.\
*Extremely fast for its class.\
*Smaller in length than most other dreadnoughts.\
*Large cargo hold.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Requires good spinal aim for effective shield breaking.\
*Turrets are not very accurate.\
*Despite its short length, it is rather large, making it a big target.\
*Spinals have awful placement, being very far from each other, which makes it very hard to shoot ships smaller than a dreadnought.\
*Limited, making it a large target.\
==Strategy==\
*Never use this ship alone. Fly in fleets with ships you are confident will be targeted before you. Never tank for your fleet.\
*Stay away from ships that are primarily spinal based, as they can hit the ship's large body with ease.\
*Avoid smaller ships, as your inaccurate turrets will be unable to hit them.\
*Pair up with a shield-breaker to maximize your combat effectivity.\
==Version History==\
*Spinals moved towards the center .75a12\
*Removed in version .75a37\
==Trivia==\
*The first person to lose the '''''Preos Adult''''' was tremblayw1, coincidentally to the [[Plagued Preos Adult]] boss.\

"Monogram","The '''''Monogram''''' is an NPC previously used as the quest giver for Quest #8 – “Lost Drone.”  \
==Description==\
The '''Monogram's''' task is to analyze a drone locked within the ice of [[Aqueous II]], but it is running out of power. The quest is to find 7 [[Artifacts|Ascension Crystals]] which can be found throughout the map and bought at [[Mega Base]]. The reward for this effort is 30,000 [[Credits]]. \

* The quest dialogue contains various grammar and punctuation errors.\
* There was a glitch that occurred when players attempted to repeat this quest. To resolve this, players would have to leave the server and rejoin to fix it.\
* The '''Monogram''' also appears as part of the pre-quest dialogue on [[Myriad III|Myriad III's]] moon.\

*Gatling turrets are good against faster, smaller ships.\
*High shield health.\
*High overall health pool.\
*Decent Spinals.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Low hull health.\
*Minimal shield damage without utilizing spinals.\
==Strategy==\
*Use both the spinals and turrets to maximize the damage output.\
*Since most ships have only topside turrets, get under your opponent and use your high turn speed to stay right below them, your pathetic shield dps will still be higher than your opponents 0.\
*Decent for countering small ships\

== Description: ==\
The '''Chimera-S''' is an upgrade to the standard [[Chimera]] Destroyer. It is, however, an AI ship and cannot be acquired by players. It has substantially more health and firepower and a higher top speed than its build menu counterpart, though it has less acceleration. It appears to be a newer version of the [[Chimera]] that is currently in [[U.N.E]] service.\
== Behavior: ==\
The '''Chimera-S''' is often seen wandering around the map until it encounters a [[Kneall]] ship. If it encounters one, it will start to attack that ship, regardless of how big said ship is, calling for reinforcements as it does so. The '''Chimera-S''' alone could beat a [[Swarmer]] or even be a match for the [[Bruiser]], however it is no match for a [[Punisher]], but the '''Chimera-S''' may stand a chance when it calls in reinforcements.\
== Strategy ==\
Allow the '''Chimera-S''' to distract the [[Aliens|Alien]] ships, while attacking them from further away than the '''Chimera-S''', allowing you to remain mostly undamaged. \
== Loot ==\
*The '''Chimera-S''' drops 140 items of loot including 87 silicate, 46 carbon, and 7 iridium.\
== Trivia ==\
* Due to the presence of the '''Chimera-S''', many people feel safer when mining.\

== Description ==\
The '''Meteor''' is a medium-sized ship with no windows and little interior. You enter by falling through the hood of the cockpit.\
== Advantages ==\
* Decent damage, can deal with both shield and hull.\
* Incredibly cheap, highly disposable and has a large explosion for it's size, making it great for suicide runs.\
* Fast for its size, matching the [[Starblade]] in speed.\
* Flat shape, making it harder to hit.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Very fragile.\
* Dependent on skill of the pilot to aim [[Spinals]].\
* Large for it's class, roughly [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser-]]sized.\
*No turrets.\
== Strategy ==\
* Since this ship is very cheap, it can be used in a suicidal run with little cost.\
* As with all other Destroyers, avoid ships like the [[Ampharos]] and [[Mjolnheimr]] as their high accuracy turrets will shred you.\
* Don't get this ship if you can't use spinals.\
* Swarms are very effective with this ship due to its great [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower.\
==Version History==\
* [[Turrets]] removed (1 Light Gatling Cannon, 1 Light Gatling Laser), 1 Small Cannon added, and received a remodel in version .69d.\
*Lost 1 Small Cannon in version .72e1?\
*Spinals nerfed from 4 Small Phasers/4 Small Cannons to 3 Tiny Phasers/3 Small Cannons, interval increased to 0.15s in version .72f1.\
== Trivia ==\
* Some people used to call this a Mini [[Razor Wing]].\
*The current model is a revamped version of the old [[Vansnova]] model.\
*The '''Meteor''' currently has the highest damage per second out of any non-limited destroyers, and is fourth to Permafrost, Viking, and Nightmare.\

"Grim_Reaper_(NPC)","{{RemovedShip}}{{Outdated (Image)}}The '''''Grim Reaper '''''was an '''[[:Category:NPC|NPC]]''' that was added during the [[Halloween Event 2018|'''Halloween Event 2018''']].\
\
{{Picture_Infobox_Mk_II}}\
\
== Description ==\
The '''Grim Reaper''' is the [[:Category:NPC|NPC]] that would give you an extremely powerful ship called the [[Grim]] for completing the quest that he gave; Death Incarnate. The quest required 100 [[Space Pumpkin|Space Pumpkins]] and 5 [[Ghost Pumpkin|Ghost Pumpkins]].\
\
== Location ==\
The '''Grim Reaper''' is located in the [[Halloween Mega Base]] in the pumpkin field.\
\
== Quest Dialog 1 ==\
<u>Grim Reaper</u>: Hey, want to do me a favor?\
\
<u>Player</u>: What is the favor?\
\
<u>Grim Reaper</u>: I noticed that the king reached his final form of evolution\
\
<u>Player</u>: Go on.\
\
<u>Grim Reaper</u>: I want you to defeat the king and loot everything he drops.\
\
<u>Player</u>: What do i need to get from him?\
\
<u>Grim Reaper</u>: You will need to get me 5 Ghost Pumpkins and 100 Space Pumpkins\
\
<u>Player</u>: What will my reward be?\
\
<u>Grim Reaper</u>: If you get me those, I will give you my true ship\
\
<u>Player</u>: I'll do it\
\
<u>Grim Reaper</u>: Good, be careful, because he is quite powerful right now.\
\
''Player obtains quest: Death Incarnate''\
\
== Completing the Quest (continued) ==\
The player then needs to obtain 5 [[Ghost Pumpkin|Ghost Pumpkins]] and 100 [[Space Pumpkin|Space Pumpkins]] by defeating a stage 3 [[Harvest King]]. This can be extremely difficult as the [[Harvest King]] can take on multiple [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] if distractions such as the [[Draco]] and [[Viper]] are not present. Once destroyed there will probably be many vultures, so stay alert. Each stage 3 [[Harvest King]] drops 1 [[Ghost Pumpkin]] and 25 [[Space Pumpkin|Space Pumpkins]]. Since a [[Harvest King]] only spawns once per round, the player must hop servers if they wish to continue. After obtaining the requirements the player must head back to the '''Grim Reaper''' to turn in the pumpkins for their prize.\
\
== Quest Dialog 2 ==\

}}\
\
==Description==\
The '''Kneall Starbase''' (also known as '''Stronghold''') is the equivalent of an '''Alien Starbase''', from which multiple aliens spawn. The conditions for which this structure spawns are currently unknown, and it's shown on the minimap as a semi-transparent green circle. \
\
Take extreme caution when going to the '''Kneall Starbase,''' its armament consists of an extreme multitude of laser gatlings, which can easily shred any shield in a matter of seconds. Due to their rapid fire, accuracy and range, they are also extremely effective against smaller ships.\
\
==Strategy==\
While the actual maximum health is unknown, it was estimated to be around 35k for both [[Shields]] and [[Hull]], making the '''Kneall Stronghold''' one of the tankiest targets in the game.\
\
Due to its range of about 8.5k and then adding also the size of the object itself, even [[Sieging|Siege]] ships may have some problems taking down a '''Kneall Stronghold'''.\
\
One of the most common strategies applied is the use of smaller and faster ships in order to draw the Starbase fire in order for heavier ships to move in and deal damage. This may take multiple attempts.\
\
Another strategy currently used involves the abuse of a small but useful blindspot that smaller ships can sneak into. By doing this, the '''Kneall Stronghold''' becomes basically defenseless and is an easy target to destroy for as long as the small ship remains in the blindspot.\
\
==Version History==\
\
*Health increased substantially in version .69f\
*Temporary removed for repairs in version .69f\
\
==Trivia==\
*The update was announced through a lore update rather than through the main update log in the Galaxy Discord Server.\
*During the [[:Category:Christmas 2020|Christmas 2020 event]], it was re-introduced but renamed to Santa's Stronghold and had a red color scheme in replacement of the Kneall's green colors.\
*The '''Kneall''' '''Stronghold''' is technically a Starbase, as players can dock in it. However, it is unknown what is inside, as no one has been able to dock inside it. ''Please update this page (with pictures) once a dock is successful''\

==Description==\
The '''U.N.E Nisos''' is a passive, [[U.N.E]] affiliated ship that is the equivalent of a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] and has high extremely high spinal firepower for its class. \
\
This ship almost never loses a fight because of its 'call' ability, where it calls all UNE ships around the map to its target. A swarm of these can take down a [[Decimator]], or a Level 5 [[Starbase]] (if they could attack starbases). \
==Behavior==\
It will leave it's guarding post to respond to other [[U.N.E]] ships' call for aid. Once the target is destroyed, it will return to the Starbase it is guarding. \
\
It is able to call other U.N.E. ships to assist it in combat, similar to a [[Punisher]]. \
\
However, since the bulk of its firepower comes from its spinals, it has a massive weakness in which once it goes close enough, it turns around in the opposite direction, losing most \
of its firepower, just like the [[Decimator]].\
\
'''Note''': The U.N.E Nisos, along with other [[U.N.E]] ships, do not spawn in private servers. \
== Strategy==\
*Lure powerful enemy AI ships such as a [[Galleon]] or [[Decimator]] to it, if engaged, it will call other [[U.N.E]] ships around the map to attack it.\
==Version History==\
*Released in version.69f.\
==Trivia==\
* Uses the old description of the [[Nisos]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Alien Harvest Servitor''' is a mini-boss ship added during the [[Halloween Event 2018|2018 Halloween Event]]. It was similar in size to the [[Aliens|Alien Punisher]], but was more powerful on its own. It cannot call other Aliens like the Punisher can, making it a viable strategy to solo these ships for their loot. They would spawn alone or alongside the [[Harvest King]]. '''Servitors''' are recognized by their orange, punisher-sized symbol on the minimap. '''Servitors''' dropped two [[Space Pumpkin]]s upon destruction, as well as various ores.\
\
== Armament ==\
The '''Servitor''' was equipped with six [[Turrets]]. They were also equipped with around 3 Medium Cannons. This combination made them incredibly deadly against even the most balanced ships, especially bigger ships that the low-accuracy Turrets could easily hit.\
\
== Strategy ==\
Distractions with small, fast ships like the [[Viper]] and [[Draco]] were effective ways to draw or avoid '''Servitors'''' fire. Despite the laser's extreme rate of fire, the accuracy of all [[Turrets]] on the '''Servitor''' is nothing compared to the speed of a Viper or Draco. Even being as close as 2000-3000 studs away poses little danger to well-piloted [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]].\
\
Outside of using a simple and easy distraction ship, players may try to brute force the kill. Unfortunately, aside from [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], not many ships could withstand the ''full fire'' of a '''Servitor''' without having to retreat and heal. They could also use a Spinal-based ship to attack the servitor from a distance, the spinal based ship would constantly drift and fire while hoping not to get hit too many times. This strategy was best used with a [[Razor Wing]].\
\
== Version History ==\
* Seat reversed in an unknown version. (it was backwards upon release, allowing it to use Spinals while moving away from the player)\
* Removed in an unknown version.\

==Description==\
The '''Starhunter''' is a fighter found in the upper fighter bay of the new Starbase remodel. It is unusual for most fighters because of its complete reliance on turret firepower for hull damage.\
==Interior==\
The '''Starhunter''' has a simple interior with a singular bucket seat in the compact cockpit.\
==Advantages==\
* Has 4 turrets.\
* Very fast.\
* Huge damage for a [[:Category:fighters|Fighter]].\
* Very high health pool.\
* Higher turn speed than the [[Fury]]\
* The fighter spawns in faction starbases.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Only spawns in the Starbase once it reaches level 3.\
* Only two of these ships can be spawned at a time per Starbase.\
*Known to glitch into the floor of Starbases sometimes when spawned.\
*Large for a fighter.\
*There is a glitch were if it has been used before the player attempting to enter it will get kicked out of the seat and the camera will focus on the starhunter as if you are piloting it, you cannot use any controls and you must reset to fix your camera.\
==Strategy==\
* Target heavy siege ships with [[Shields|shield]] based health like the [[Judgement]], they will have a difficult time destroying you while you quickly destroy their shields with your phasers.\
*Hide in blindspots, or fighter bays when attacking [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]].\
==Version History==\
* Re-added in version .68b\
* Speed reduced from 325 to 225 in version .69b1\
* Significant spinal nerf: [F] spinals size reduced to tiny, [G] spinals kept the same size but with the interval nerfed from 0.1 seconds to a barely manageable 0.6 seconds in version .73c(?)\
==Trivia==\
* On April 19th 2020, this fighter and the new Starbase remodel was enabled for around ten minutes on the new servers before it was reverted to the old version.\

The '''Scythe''' has a small pass-through door in the back with a cross-brace over it. This door leads to an opening in the center of the ship, which is decorated with the marble and gray style seen on the outside. The Scythe also contains a rather fancy pilot seat facing a neon panel.\
==Advantages==\
*High [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower.\
*Highly maneuverable.\
*Both energy and kinetic weaponry. (Energy does more damage to [[Shields]] and kinetic does more damage to [[Hull]].)\
*Great acceleration allows it to get out of retreat situations.\
*Can distract inaccurate base turrets with its high top-speed and small size.\
*Great for outrunning fleets, hit and run pirating, or stealing kills.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Lacks [[Turrets]].\
*Requires good [[Spinals|Spinal]] aim to be effective in PvP.\
*Low total health. (1050)\

\
== Completing the Quest ==\
After you talk to the scientist, the [[Kodiak]] will spawn and roam the map (only if the spawn cooldown is inactive). Killing the [[Kodiak]] will have it drop Kodiak Armor Pieces, 3 of which and 800k credits are required to complete the quest. After you finish the quest, the [[Kodiak]] spawn cooldown will start. The quest also gives the Kodiak Activator, which is used in [[Depthbreaker|Depthbreaker]]. Only spawn the [[Kodiak]] if you are prepared and have a team ready, as it can destroy a [[Starbase|Level 2 Starbase]] and many [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] alone.\

==Description==\
The '''Patriotic Wasp''' is a limited variant the [[Wasp]] equipped with a [[Turrets|Patriotic Mining Laser]].\
==Appearance==\
According to Yname, the '''Patriotic Wasp'''<nowiki/>'s model was accidentally deleted with other Patriotic ship models. It featured a red, white, and blue color scheme but otherwise remains largely unchanged relative to the regular Wasp.\
==Advantages==\
*Large mining laser allows for fast mining compared to the Wasp.\
*Like the Wasp, it's small and fast and capable of escaping dire situations if needed. \
==Disadvantages==\
*Somewhat low ore hold.\
*Somewhat low health.\
*Limited class means it'll be targeted by pirates. \
==Strategies==\
*Do not mine at war at all, it's a limited ship and there is a very high probability it'll be targeted.\
*Mine close to your base to ensure that if any enemies are coming, that you can dock quickly and respawn.\
*Check the mini-map often, look out for any alien or pirate ships that are around.\
==Version History==\
*Had it's [[Turrets|Large Patriotic Mining Laser]] swapped out for a [[Turrets|Patriotic Mining Laser]], increased the range from 6,175 to 6,500 in version .75a10.\
==Trivia==\
*When fired, the Patriotic Mining Laser pushes the Patriotic Wasp due to the Wasp being tiny.\

"War","{{Outdated}}\
'''War''' is a fundamental game mechanic of Galaxy, as progression in the game focuses mainly on obtaining warships, [[Bounty|Bounties]], and [[Score]]. \
\
== Starting a War ==\
When the leader of a faction declares war on another faction, there will be a 90-second period in-between the declaration of war and the commencement of the war itself. Additionally, any allies of the warred faction that are not also allied to the warring faction will also be automatically placed in the war. Factions that are allied to both will have their alliance with the warring faction automatically canceled.\
\
Any factions that are not at war with the warring factions will not be affected by the war. Most wars often fall into either open conflict where neither side fights with a true goal, often engaging in small skirmishes, [[Pirating]], [[Sieging]], or blockading the [[Mega Base]] to cut off enemy trade. Any ships that are destroyed in a war will be lost permanently, and can only be regained through a player's own means.\
\
=== Wait Time ===\
In the 90 second time period of the war being initiated, players can neither engage ships of the opposing faction nor the opposing faction's [[Starbase]]. Leaders of both factions may agree to a peace request at any time during that 90 second period to immediately cancel the war. After 80 seconds, a 10-second warning notification will appear in the message bar alerting both factions that the war will begin imminently. When a war begins, players can engage enemy ships and Starbases in conflict.\
\
== Advantages ==\
You can earn a lot of credits from killing other ships for combat rewards.\
you can loot starbase's that you have killed, the loot can often be worth 100,000 credits.\
\
\
=== Restrictions ===\
* Factions with a '''level one''' Starbase can only declare war on 1 factions at a time.\
* Factions with a '''level two''' Starbase can only declare war on 2 factions at a time.\
* Factions with a '''level three''' Starbase can only declare war on 3 factions at a time.\
* Factions with a '''level four''' Starbase can only declare war on 4 factions at a time.\
\
== Ending a War ==\
In order to cease an ongoing war, both sides must agree to peace. However, it is not possible to stop a war during the endgame when three or fewer factions remain. All newly declared wars will be permanent until the server resets from a win condition.\

"Luca_Sky","'''''Luca Sky''''' is a Quest NPC added during the [[Galaxy Star Wars Event|'''Galaxy Star Wars Event''']] alongside [[Billy Ray Joe|'''Billy Ray Joe''']].{{Picture_Infobox_Mk_II|title1 = Luca Sky|image1 = LucaskyV75.png}}\
\
== Description ==\
'''Luca Sky''' used to give the player Quest #1 -- Help the Freedom Base, which required players to deliver three [[Medicine & Supplies]] to the [[Freedom Base]]. \
\
A [[Pirates|Pirate Avenger]] spawned at the [[Freedom Base]] upon accepting the quest, making it harder to simply dock and sell the medicine to the station. Upon completion players were be given a few credits and, during the promotional event, the [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/566779626/Interstellar-Sunglasses Interstellar Sunglasses]. In the latest version before the quest was disabled, the [[Freedom Base]] quest gave players a reward of 300 [[Credits]].  \
\
Quests number 1 and 2 were disabled later on, though their respective quest NPCs still linger in the Mega Base. Both '''Luca Sky''' and Billy Ray Joe currently serve no purpose and are simply vestigial game assets no longer in use.\
\
== Location ==\
'''Luca Sky''' can be found inside the [[Mega Base]] between terminals C and D, beside the Alien translation board and in front of an ad display board.\
\
== Quest Dialogue ==\
<u>Luca Sky</u>: \"Oh this is terrible! Someone please help me!\"\
\
<u>Player</u>: \"What's wrong?\" or \"I don't have time for this.\"\
\
<u>Luca Sky</u>: \"A strange plague has broken out at the Freedom Base and they need Medicine & Supplies badly.\"\
\
<u>Player</u>: \"So what's the problem?\"\
\
<u>Luca Sky</u>: \"I tried to bring them Medicine & Supplies but some filthy pirates blew up my ship before I could get there.\"\
\
<u>Player</u>: \"Let me do it then!\" or \"Sorry I can't help you.\"\
\
<u>Luca Sky</u>: \"Ok good luck! You'll need to bring the Freedom Base 3 crates of Medicine & Supplies.\"\
\
''You have a new quest: Help the Freedom Base -- Quest #1 appears in Quest Menu''\

The '''''Unarmed Envoy''''' was a small, limited remake of the [[Dropship]] [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]] that uses a reskinned old model, and is a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]]-[[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] hybrid, eventually removed once it stopped spawning on the Lucifer Station.\

== Description ==\
The '''Unarmed Envoy''' was a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] with no weapons whatsoever. It is meant purely for distracting bases or to scout what ships the enemy faction has.

This ship could have been found on [[Frion I|Lucifer Station]], but it and the [[Dragonfly]] were replaced by the [[Striker]] and [[Xenophile]].\
\
== Appearance ==\
The back of The '''Unarmed Envoy''' has two large benches containing six seats in total. The cockpit has a small pilot's seat.\
\
== Advantages ==\
* Has high health for a ship of its class.\
* Quite fast, despite its slow acceleration.\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Has slow acceleration compared to other fighters.\
* Weakest fighter in the game, this is because it has no weapons, as expected for a ship of its name.\
\
== Strategy ==\
* Use the Fighter's manageable speed to scout out enemy bases or distract enemy ships.\
\
== Version History ==\
* Received a buff in .64d? that increased this Fighter's [[Hull]] and [[Shields]] by 300 each, and another buff that gave it one [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannon]], which made the name confusing.\
* Started spawning on Lucifer Station in .65b.\
* 1 [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannon]] removed in version .69a2, which once again made the ship true to its name.\
*Stopped spawning on Lucifer Station in version .73b, along with the [[Dragonfly]], this marked this ship's removal from the game.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Unarmed Envoy '''once had 1 [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannon]], which was ironic considering it's name is the '''''Unarmed ''Envoy.'''\
* The spawner used to be broken.\

== Description ==\
'''''Galaxy Private Servers''''' are private servers on Galaxy that require a direct invitation by link or by having a Roblox friend that owns one open to friends. It costs 100 Robux per month for the user to have a single private server. Additional servers will still cost players 100 Robux per month. If the user does not have enough Robux to pay the next month, the server cannot be used until the payment is sent again.\
\
Private servers allow easy money gain and a much lower risk of you losing your ships to [[Pirating|pirating players]]. [[Aliens]] and [[Pirates]] still spawn on private servers, which can be extremely dangerous if you are playing alone. It allows a max of 50 players and the owner can name the server however they wish.\

==Appearance==\
The Interceptor F is a small fighter with a unique shape that looks like an aquatic creature, consisting of most notable feature of this ship is the two large barrels on each end of its wings, which is where its spinals shoot from. Like the [[Instigator]], the rear end of the ship rises up a bit, which is where its [[Turrets|Light Cannon]] sits.\
\
The '''Interceptor F''''s interior is so small that the user cannot even fit completely inside the cockpit. It consists only of a simple pilot's seat and some neon lights.\

== Appearance ==\
The Anathema has no interior design; Only sporting a fabric-green seat and a teleporter. It has the exact same model as the NPC variant of the Anathema.\
== Advantages ==\
Good against hull based ships like the [[Armageddon]], due to the turrets being hull based.\
\
Good health for a battlecruiser.\
\
Fast for a battlecruiser, clocking at 130 speed.\
\
High accuracy turrets.\
== Disadvantages ==\
Large size for a battlecruiser makes it easier to hit.\

Requires good spinal aim to deal suffiencient damage to sheild.\
\
Turrets are hull based, making it harder to kill sheild based ships.\
\
Requires 35 [[Remnant Spore|Remnant Spores]], which are hard to get.\

This is good for taking on battleships and below with a skilled pilot, use your high manueverability to destroy your opponents.\

==Description ==\
The '''Mega Elanis''' was a powerful ship with stats roughly between those of Battleships and Dreadnoughts. It is unobtainable and impossible to spawn due to a generation error. \
\
It is a cheaply-made [[Elanis]] with another [[Elanis]] model turned 90 degrees. The arament is changed to 8 Small Railguns and you can even notice that the Mega [[Elanis]] has 2 cannons glitched into each other as a result of duplication. This shows the poorly made model which MAY have something to do with its loading error.\
\
It was released during the [[April Fool's Event 2022]] and taken offsale on April 2nd when the event ended.\
==Interior==\
There is no interior on the Mega Elanis, you are completely exposed to the infinite no-oxygen area of Galaxy.\
==Advantages==\
* AMAZING Dps for a Battlecruiser, and a single one can take down a Punisher.\
*Good health pool.\
*The fastest Battlecruiser BY FAR.\
*Shreds Hull.\
==Disadvantages== \
*Cannot be spawned in at the moment, rendering it useless.\
==Strategy==\
*Use this ship when it gets released and when it does, swarm your enemies in a brutal frenzy!\
* Go with an escort, such as a Carrier.\
* Keep it as a trophy, since it technically can't have any other use.\
== Version History==\
* Brought to the Battlecruiser Build menu for free on March 31st, 2022, at the beginning of the April Fools' event.\
*Taken offsale with the end of the April Fool's Event 2022, while being unspawnable after that.\
==Trivia==\
*Was poorly <s>made</s> copied.\
*One of the 2 ships that was released for free on the April Fools' Event of 2022.\

==Description==\
The '''Phalanx''' was the Personal Admin Ship of [[Galaxy Staff|oShadowWarrioro]]. It was modeled after the Lascaux Heavy Command Carrier (also made by [[Galaxy Staff|oShadowWarrioro]]) and was massive.\
\
== Appearance ==\
???\
\
==Advantages==\
*Strong [[Shields]].\
*Turns faster than most battleships.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
*No weapons.\
*It was the length of two [[Apocalypse]]s and is extremely easy to hit.\
*Its Top Speed is quite low considering its other maneuverability stats.\
\
== Strategy ==\
* Fly around in a massive unarmed warship and mock the size of other ships.\
* Dodge [[Spinals]] with grace with its abnormal turn rate.\
* Tank all damage with its absurd shield health.\
\
== Version History ==\
* It's health used to be overpowered until V6, having had 260,000 before getting nerfed to 5000/5000, before getting another buff with the V8 Model that gave it 900,000.\
* The previous designs of this ship were the Ares, U.S.S. Enterprise (Star Trek: ToS), ASF Shiden II, and U.S.S. Vengeance (Star Trek: Into Darkness)\
* It's V8 remodel had the most HP out of any ship in the game at a whopping 900,000 until the addition of the [[Spectating Ship]] and [[Chad Swarmer]].\
* Removed along with most of the '''[[:Category:Admin|Admin Ships]]''' in version .62a1.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Phalanx''' has had 7 different speeds: 1500, 500, 450, 425, 3000, 8000, and finally 40.\
* The second version of this ship was extremely buggy, and 3 more fixes had to be pushed out by [[Galaxy Staff|oShadowWarrioro]] before he could get it to actually work right.\
*After testing, a person from 0% [[Loyalty]] who spawned this ship, if they accelerate while not in endgame, would have had 3% [[Loyalty]] by the time it reached full speed in its final model\
* The ship itself has been updated a total of 9 times in its history, despite being a recent addition.\

==Description==\
The '''Demon''' is a Battlecruiser from the [[Halloween Event 2019]] that is no longer obtainable. It is very versatile, with light Gatling guns to deal with smaller [[Ships]] to Quad Advanced Medium Cannons and a Dual Medium cannon to deal with bigger foes. Correctly using its [[Spinals]] is essential as its [[Turrets]] provide little to none shield damage.\
\
== Appearance ==\
There is a teleporter in the back of the ship, it leads to a small confined area. The driver's seat is a red orb.\
\
==Advantages==\
*Powerful [[Spinals]].\
*Relatively fast.\
*Tanky for a Battlecruiser.\
*Insane kinetic [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
*Hard to see because of its black colors.\
*Great maneuvrability.\
*Can be a threat to smaller and faster [[Ships]] due to it having 4 Light Turrets.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
*User needs to know how to use Spinals or this ship will struggle to destroy [[Shields]].\
*Will be hunted, due to it being a limited ship.\
*Very expensive for a Battlecruiser, costing even more than some Battleships.\
\
==Strategy==\
*Try to hit as many spinals as possible.\
*Use the insane kinetic turret firepower to shred through [[Hull]].\
*Try to go below the ship you are attacking as most of your [[Turrets]] are on top.\
*Try to go against [[Ships]] which are hulled or are Hull-focused.\
\
==Version History==\
*Added during the [[Halloween Event 2019]] in version .66b\
==Trivia==\
*Resembles a lobster, reflecting the description as a \"creature of the void\"\
*Periodically emits a spooky wail.\
*First one to die was Spinny101's, which was killed by Deathunterz123's [[Lucifer]].\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Scourge''' is the [[Halloween Event 2020]] equivalent of the Alien [[Punisher]]. \
\
== Armament ==\
The '''Scourge''' is armed with 3 Huge/Large(?) [[Spinals|Cannons]], and 8(?) Custom Cannon [[Turrets]]. It is not that powerful on its own; it cannot fire its turrets directly ahead because of a bad mounting angle. This is the assumed reason for its secondary spinal weapons.\
\
== Strategy ==\
The '''Scourge''' has a huge blind spot behind it. By exploiting this blind spot, some players have been able to solo it with nothing but a Frigate or Destroyer (like an [[Aura]]) Doing so allows players to solo these ships and keep their loot to themselves.\
\
As with [[Alien Serv]]s and [[Punisher]]s, distractions with small, fast ships like the [[Viper]] and [[Draco]] are effective ways to draw this ship's fire while pest-controller ships with high-accuracy turrets deal all the damage.\
\
It is relatively easy to brute force the kill with any ship, as there is a blind spot directly behind it where it cannot shoot you.\
== Loot ==\
* [[Ores]]: 425 Silicate, 344 Carbon, 224 Iridium, 11 Adamantite, 30 Palladium, 17 Titanium, 17 Quantium, and 5 Uranium.\
*10 [[Gamma Pumpkin]]s.\
[[File:Roblox Galaxy - Alien Scourge Ship - Observation|thumb|293x293px|Alien Scourge]]\
\
== Version History ==\
* Gamma pumpkin drop rate nerfed in version .69a1 20 -> 15\
* Buffed in version .69b5, being able to call Alien Servs to help it against enemies.\
\
==Trivia==\
* For the first few days, it does not appear to call any Alien Servs or other '''Scourges''' to its location when attacked.\
* Below are some videos of the Alien Scourge:\

== Description ==\
The '''Santaliz''' is a limited Battleship class ship based on the [[Sentaliz]].\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Santaliz''' is very simple. (Add more)\
== Advantages ==\
* High mobility.\
* Powerful [[spinals|Spinal]] armament.\
* Good amount of health for its speed, higher total health than it's [[Sentaliz|normal counterpart]]\
* Does not require [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]], unlike its [[Sentaliz|normal counterpart]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
*Bad [[Turrets|Turret]] placement and low firepower.\
*Expensive; costs as much as a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
*Spinal barrels are spread out, making hitting smaller targets more challenging.\
*Lower acceleration and no torpedoes unlike its normal counterpart.\
== Strategy ==\
*Warp out of combat if your shield health is low. Most people will try to dive it if they see it hulled.\
*Do not overestimate its speed, It is not very strong on its own. It can easily be destroyed by a skilled team.\
*Use this as you would use a [[Hallow]].\
== Version History ==\
* In version .75a, 4 [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Phasers]] replaced by 2 [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Torpedoes]], 6 [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Cannons]] reduced to 3 [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Cannons]], 2 [[Turrets|Light Gattling Lasers]] replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Splitters]].\
* Custom Max drift is now 90% .75a12\
*Explosion size 40 ----> 440 .75a12\

* Has very small icon on mini-map.\
* Faster than some [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Spider''' is a [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]].''' '''It''' '''deals significant shield damage for a ship of its class. It is a decently fast ship. The ship is shaped similarly to the [[Archangel]].\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Spider''' has very little in the way of an interior. Inside, there is simply a small pilot seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Decent speed.\
* Ties with the [[Abyss]] for the best turn speed in the game.\
* Very small.\
* Has an adequate armament of [[Spinals]].\
* A very good nuke ship, as it is cheap and does 250 explosion damage.\
*Dirt cheap. Even [[Wasp]] owners can mass-produce these.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No [[Turrets]].\
* No other weaponry that can output more damage to [[Hull]].\
* Low health, lower than some [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* You have to be able to aim [[Spinals]] in order to use this ship.\
* Tied with the [[Starblade]] and the [[Dropship]] as the slowest [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]].\

* Stick to other [[ships]] from your faction as you are vulnerable and rather weak alone.\
* Join up with an [[Abyss]] to take down larger ships. You take care of the shield, and they take care of the hull.\

* Added in .65a.\

==Description==\
The '''Double Fractal''' is an event Frigate. It is made out of wood and ice, with the wood poking out of the ice cover on the sides for the barrels, and the base of the barrels completely engulfed in ice.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Double Fractal''' is a detailed cabin with a screen in front of it.\
==Advantages==\
* Good firepower for a [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]].\
* It has more health than any other Frigate in the game.\
* Decent speed.\
==Disadvantages==\
* No [[turrets]].\
* It is large for a Frigate, making it easier to hit.\
* Expensive for a Frigate.\
* Will get targeted for being an event ship.\
* You can never get it back once it is destroyed.\
* The [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]] only fire out of one cannon making it harder to aim them.\
== Strategy ==\
*Treat this ship as a trophy, nothing more than a flex.\
*If you really want to use these, use them to swarm larger ships, using your speed and health to absorb, (some) hits, try to get into blind spots and unleash you spinals, which do a lot of damage, once you are at 300 shield or so retreat, as your hull is extremely fragile.\
==Version History==\
*No logged changes.\
==Trivia==\
* It is the first frigate of the Christmas event 2019 and was introduced on the second phase.\
* Somewhat resembles the [[Icicle]] from part 1 of the event.\
* All of the [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]] fire out of the right barrel.\
* Has a visual bug on its phasers where they appear to be coming from behind the ship.\
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a E class permit (310k credits) + 208 Sillicate, 117 Carbon, 115 Iridium\

== Description ==\
The '''Patriotic Defiance''' is an event re-skin of the [[Defiance]] for the [[:Category:Fourth of July 2019|2019 4th of July event]]. It is a powerful Destroyer that deals very high damage with its [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]]. It has the same exterior as the normal Defiance, but is instead mostly white with red and blue details to make it look patriotic.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Patriotic Defiance''' shares its interior with its regular counterpart, but with a revamped red, white, and blue color scheme.\
== Advantages ==\
* High damage output for its class.\
* Fast, maneuverable, and small.\
* No blind spots.\
* The [[Turrets]] are in a good position to simultaneously fire with [[Spinals]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Needs good [[Spinals|Spinal]] aim to do hull damage.\
* Somewhat slow for a Destroyer, rivaling some Battlecruisers.\
* If lost after the event you won't be able to get it back.\
== Strategy ==\
* Go for larger ships or [[Spinals|Spinal]] based ships as you cannot deal with ships that use [[Turrets|Light Turrets]].\
* Make sure to exploit the blind spots of larger and less mobile ships in order to deal the most damage without dying.\
* The '''Patriotic Defiance''' is also useful for hunting [[Aliens]] with its many high-accuracy [[Turrets]].\
== Version History ==\
* Added in version .65b on July 5th as part of the 2019 Fourth of July event.\
*Removed along with most other reskin ships in (unknown version please add).\
== Trivia ==\
* It has 100 more hull than the [[Defiance]].\
*Could be mistaken for the Maple ships due to its design not having much blue on it.\

==Description==\
The '''Grim Reaper''' was an AI similar to [[Pirates]] and [[Aliens]], except it was even stronger than some Dreadnoughts at the time. You had to destroy the '''Grim Reaper''' multiple times and collect Pumpkins for the [[Halloween Quest]]. It could have dropped up to 4 at a time. The '''Grim Reaper''' is the equivalent of a [[Starbase|Level 3 Starbase]]. The '''Grim Reaper''' had an icon similar to an [[Aliens|Alien Punisher]] except it was orange and a lot bigger. The '''Grim Reaper''' has total 18k health, [[Spinals|12 Phasers]], [[Spinals|1 Huge Cannon]], and several Plasma Turrets. The '''Grim Reaper''' is able to solo a [[Starbase|Level 3 Starbase]]. The '''Grim Reaper''' only spawned once per round and the server must have had at least 5 players in it for it to spawn.\
\
== Strategy ==\
Stay mobile and don't let it outsmart you, however, also try to land as many [[Spinals|Spinal]] hits as you can. If you are fighting in a group, it's best to take different [[Ships]], such as the [[Ridgebreaker]] to tank and dish out damage, a fast dread like the [[Slipstream]], to distract the [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]], and a few [[Leviathan]]s or [[Nemesis]]es to deal a lot of extra damage. If you had a large team, a powerful Carrier could have done the job.\
\
The '''Grim Reaper''' may be removed but is still in the game files and [[Rcouret]] can spawn it anytime he likes.\

==Description==\
The '''Apostle''' is a good pirating ship armed with several [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]]. It is also relatively fast for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]] with good [[hull]] and [[shields]] for its class.\
==Advantages==\
*Has powerful [[Spinals]] for both [[shields|shield]] and [[hull]].\
*Relatively high top speed.\
*High turn speed.\
*Despite the ship's description saying it lacks many defensive capabilities, it has high health.\
*Overall balanced damage between [[Shields|shield]] and [[hull]] (better [[Shields|shield]] breaking [[spinals]] but more [[hull]] damaging [[turrets]]).\
==Disadvantages==\
* Very vulnerable to [[ships]] with large amounts of [[Turrets]] such as the [[Ampharos]].\
* Has poor [[Turrets|turret]] placement, with turrets on the bottom of the ship.\
* Vulnerable top side\
\
==Strategy==\
*Get a large group of these and use them to swarm larger targets.\
*Warp near isolated [[:Category:Miner|miners]] and dispatch them as soon as possible.\
*Avoid approaching an enemy [[Starbase]] alone.\
*Stay above your enemy so your turrets can hit along with your spinals.\
==Version History==\
* Max Shield reduced from 880 to 800, spinal barrels reduced from 6/3 to 4/2 in version .66b.\
\
==Trivia==\
*Oddly enough, the in-game description describes this [[Ships|ship]] as a glass cannon, but it has more health than some Cruisers.\
*It has a similar design to the [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sith_fighter] Sith Fighter from the Old Republic Era in the Star Wars lore.\

The '''Starbase Fury''' is a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter Class]] ship with balanced spinal firepower that is used to defend [[Starbase]]s. It is found in [[Starbase]]s level 2 and above, and possibly inside the [[Mothership]]???\
\
The '''Starbase Fury''' is about the size of a [[Wasp]], just like the regular [[Fury]]. Its appearance is similar to that of a fighter jet.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Starbase Fury's''' interior is entered through its cockpit window. Inside, there is simply a single seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Groups of these can deal decent damage to any ships attacking a Starbase, even if the ship is hulled.\
* Fast and highly maneuverable.\
* Has more firepower and health than its Carrier-based counterpart.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Easily hit by [[Ships]] with [[Turrets|Light Turrets]].\
* Somewhat low health compared to other [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
== Strategy ==\
* '''Starbase Furies''' are seen defending against enemies attacking their base, whether it be aliens / pirates or a player siege. A skilled '''swarm''' can obliterate shield or hull with equal efficiency. The strategy with '''Starbase Furies''' is to dive-bomb if the target is large, or slow down and wait for your target to move into a vulnerable position if they're too fast or small.\
* Deal as much damage as possible before being destroyed by your target. Fire your [[Spinals]] as often as possible.\
*If your base is being attacked and you don't want to risk any of your ships, use one of these as they will respawn and you lose nothing if they get destroyed.\
== Version History ==\
* Nerfed in version .68b—top speed reduced from 400 to 200.\
* Speed fixed in version .69a1—decreased from 400 to 275.\
== Trivia ==\
* Has a lighter counterpart in both the [[Fury]] and [[Frenzy]]. The counterparts also have slightly different models.\

==Description==\
The '''Templar''' is a Cruiser introduced in the 2nd part of the Mega Update with powerful anti-sub-cruiser capabilities. It is shaped roughly like a wedge and has similar styling to the [[Apocalypse]], along with a [[Vanguard Coalition]] logo on the stern. Its armament is composed entirely of turrets, unlike most other Cruisers.\
==Interior==\
The '''Templar''' has no interior. An invisible teleporter puts the player into a small box inside with a black square that acts as the pilot's seat.\
==Advantages==\
*Cheap for its armament.\
*Powerful against smaller [[Ships]] like Fighters or Frigates.\
*Good for beginners, as no aiming skill is needed due to a lack of spinals.\
==Disadvantages==\
\
*One significant blind-spot below the ship. Shared with [[Apocalypse|the dreadnought that it is widely thought to be a miniature variant of]].\
==Strategy==\
*Use this ship in a siege to ward off Frigates, Destroyers, or Fighters when you don't have enough loyalty for more powerful options.\
*Stay below enemy [[Ships]] to maximize turret line-of-sight.\
==Version History==\
*Received a remodel in version .67c\
*Team colors fixed in version .68e.\
*Hull reduced from 1500 to 1200 and Top Speed reduced from 120 to 110 in version .69f.\
*1 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Cannon]] removed and 2 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Cannons]] moved underneath the ship in version .70a.\
*[[Turrets|1 Light Gatling Cannon]] moved back from the bottom to the top, Shield health increased from 750 to 900, and overall turret placement adjusted in version .75a5.\
==Trivia==\
* This ship has the most turrets for a Cruiser.\

There were debates on the discord server talking about how to get the blue torpedo added in, but sadly, Blue Torp didn't make it to the 2nd level of voting due to the sheer amount of dislikes.

==Description==\
The '''Green Snake''' is a reskin of the [[Cobra]] available during the [[Halloween Event 2018]]. Most of the ship is scaly and green, resembling a snake. The design itself is nearly identical to the [[Cobra]], as are most of the stats.\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Green Snake''' is almost identical to that of the [[Cobra]]. A large opening containing several seats that line the walls, as well as the pilots' seat up front.\
==Advantages==\
*Good [[Shields]] for its class.\
*A lot of shield damage with its [[Spinals]].\
==Disadvantages ==\
*Has nearly identical stats to the [[Cobra]], which is mediocre at best.\
==Strategy==\
*Do not use this ship as a replacement for the [[Cobra]], as they have nearly identical stats.\
==Version History==\
*Added in .65a\
*No other logged changes.\
==Trivia==\
*Added for the [[Halloween Event 2018]].\
*Between the '''Green Snake''', and its normal buildable counterpart, the [[Cobra]] [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]]; the '''Green Snake''' has only 2 additional [[Spinals|Small Phasers]].\
*There are 4 hidden seats on the left side of the interior.\
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a E class permit (310k credits) + 710 Sillicate, 497 Carbon, 348 Iridium\

==Description==\
The '''Vengeance''' is a small and highly agile [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] that has entirely [[Spinals|spinal-based]] weaponry. It roughly resembles a jet fighter with a thin main body, two wings mounted off both sides of the back, and two vertical fins set at opposing angles. The front of the ship has two sets of two glowing rings, as well as four barrels lined up along the front edge. The two rear wings also have their own set of tri-barrels mounted on the front edge.\
==Interior==\
The '''Vengeance''' has an extremely basic interior, with just one plain seat for the pilot.\
==Advantages==\
*Has high firepower and speed which allowed it to be a great hit and run ship.\
*Has mobility comparable to a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
*High health.\
*Good for siege support.\
*Fast.\
*Very high cargo hold for a ship of its class.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Very expensive for a Cruiser.\
*Due to its lack of [[Turrets]] it is unable to fight well against small ships.\
*Requires good spinal aim to effectively utilize this ship.\
==Strategy==\
*Due to its high speed and burst damage, it should be used to hit and run large ships.\
*Stay away from shield-shredding ships so you don't lose this ship.\
*Keep at range against small ships. If you do, the Phasers and Cannons will shred them.\
*Can be used as a pirate ship, due to its high spinal damage and cargo hold.\
==Version History==\
*This ship has not yet been changed yet.\
*Disabled and taken off sale until a remodel is available (version .69a2).\
*Re-enabled in version .72f\
==Trivia==\
*A tankier [[Crucible]]\
*Has a design like the [[Christmas Event 2018|Christmas 2018]] remodels\

==Description==\
The '''''Jormungand''''' is a [[Pirates|Pirate]] [[AI]] that has high shield damage compared to other [[Pirates|Pirate]] ships.\
==Behavior==\
The Jormungand behaves identically to the pattern of an [[AI]] ship. This ship, like the [[Dragoon]] and weaker [[Aliens]], cannot call reinforcements to its side, but will respond to the calls of [[Kodiak]], [[X-0]], or [[Galleon]].\
\
1-3 Jormungands have a chance to spawn every 10 Minutes.\
\
One unusual factor about it that sets it unique from other [[AI]] Ships is that you can grab its attention up to 25k Studs away, unlike the normal 14k Stud attention range. This means that if you were 20k Studs away from a Jormungand, it would lock on to you.\
==Strategy==\
* Move near it so that it turns its back from you and blocks its spinals from firing.\
* If you don't plan on using a capital ship, it is suggested to use a ship with powerful spinal weaponry like the [[Razor Wing]] or [[Guillotine]]\
* The Jormungand can not be seen without the [[Minimap]] for ~100k studs.\
==Loot==\
10 [[Armor Scrap]], 50 [[Material Scrap]] and ~5.5k in combat rewards.\
==Version History==\
*4 Small Phasers on the [F] spinal changed to 3 Small Phasers, and 2 Phasers added as the [G] spinal in version ???.\
*15 Armor Scraps added for loot in version .73c10.\
*Size up-scaled, combat rewards increased by ~65%, can now detect up to 6k away instead of 14k away in version .74b17.\
*Model changed from [[Nidhogg]] to [[Radiance]] in version .75a15. \
==Trivia==\
*This ship was added to the game without being announced in the [[Update Log]].\
*The name of this ship comes from Norse Mythology, from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungand Jörmungandr], otherwise known as the World Serpent.\

Some windows and features normally seen on the Mega Base have also been removed to keep the ship small and to remove complexity that could cause performance issues.\
==Interior==\
The '''Toy Mega Base''' has no interior; pilots sit on a seat positioned above the mini-observatory.\
==Advantages==\
* High cargo hold.\
* Overall high health for a freighter of its size.\
*It's small, making it hard for ships to hit.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Limited, making it an excellent target for pirates & players.\
* Somewhat slow.\
* The C-class permit requirement makes it very expensive to re-obtain if lost.\
==Strategy==\
* Make sure to trade in a [[Factions|Faction]] that is not at war and has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have wars, try your best to be safe.\
* Go to the [[Mega Base]] when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a war, as there might be a pirate waiting for you. If there is, stay at your base.\
* Check how far away the closest [[Aliens|Alien]] is and where it is heading to.\
==Version History==\
* In .69a1, it was added to the 2021 Christmas Event. It was available in the build menu under ‘freighter’.\
*Cargo Hold increased from 2000 to 2250 and Acceleration doubled in version .70a.\
==Trivia==\
* Unlike the full-sized [[Mega Base]], the interior of this resized Mega Base is completely empty.\

==Description==\
The '''Kneall Scout''' is a Kneall fleet ship added in an Alien AI update, along with a few others (like the [[Kneall Bruiser|Bruiser]] and [[Kneall Outrider|Outrider]]). \
==Behavior==\
Moves in the same way as other Alien AI ships, warping a random amount, then turning and warping again.\
\
'''Scouts''' will always answer a call from an [[Punisher|Alien Punisher]] when it is attacking any player or Starbase. Hordes of '''Scouts''' can easily destroy [[Starbase]]s, even if said Starbase is the maximum level. They will either start to scatter, go to another nearby Punisher (if there is one), or move away from the location when the Punisher they are called to is destroyed.\
\
'''Scouts''' are more likely to attack [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]], so stay alert and look at the [[Minimap]] often when [[Mining]] or [[Trading]].\
==Strategy==\
Almost impossible to hit with spinals, as the '''Scout '''is smaller than most ships in the game. Use AA ships like the '''[[Tempest]], [[Ampharos]], or [[Loyalist]].'''\
\
Even when using these ships, the pilot has to be at point blank range (200 studs or less) to have a high chance of actually hitting the scout. This will most likely entail warping, as the '''Scout '''is 4x as fast as the Loyalist, and 7x as fast as the Tempest.\
==Loot==\
5 Silicate, 3 Carbon, and 5 Alien parts.\
==Trivia==\
* The Scout was originally intended to be a mining drone.\
* A crashed Kneall scout can be seen in what appears to be a shield generator on Myriad III.\
* Until recently, they were one of the only two Kneall Fleet ships not to spawn randomly, with the other being the [[Kneall Prototype]], which still doesn't randomly spawn.\
* Doesn't actually scout enemy vessels, but acts in the same way the '''Swarmer '''does.\
* After its removal, it returned in the form of 4 admin ships that share the same model: '''[[Key]]''', '''[[Key1]]''', '''[[Key2]]''', and '''[[Key3]]'''.\

==Description==\
The '''Sovereign-X''' is a passive, [[U.N.E]] affiliated ship that is the equivalent of a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] and has high DPS for its class. \
\
This ship almost never loses a fight because of its 'call' ability, where it calls all UNE ships around the map to its target. A swarm of these can take down a [[Decimator]], or a Level 5 [[Starbase]] (if they could attack starbases). \
==Behavior==\
The '''Sovereign-X''' is seen guarding the U.N.E. Starbase, and the [[Mega Base]] in the [[Kneall Event]]. It will leave it's guarding post to respond to other [[U.N.E]] ships' call for aid. Once the target is destroyed, it will return to the Starbase it is guarding. \
\
It is able to call other U.N.E. ships to assist it in combat, similar to a [[Punisher]]. \
\
'''Note''': The Sovereign-X, along with other [[U.N.E]] ships, do not spawn in private servers. \
== Strategy==\
*Lure powerful enemy AI ships such as a [[Galleon]] or [[Decimator]] to it, if engaged, it will call other [[U.N.E]] ships around the map to attack it.\
==Version History==\
*Released in version.69.\
*Rearmed and Buffed in Version .70a8\
*Spawned naturally along with other [[U.N.E]] capital ships during the [[Kneall Event]] in version .75a10.\
*Disabled from spawning naturally due to the conclusion of the [[Kneall Event]] in version .75a11.\
==Trivia==\
*Second [[U.N.E]] ship added in Galaxy.\
*Same as the [[Sovereign]], it has the exact same description as the [[Hawklight]].\
* The Sovereign-X has a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] icon in-game, but it is actually classed as a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\

The '''''Tyrant''''' was a planned Super Capital ship planned to release during Beta. However, it was deemed to be way too overpowered and ended up being scrapped.\
\
==Description==\
The '''Tyrant''' has a similar shape to [[Hyperion]], but with different decoration and color scheme.\
==Interior==\
It's a gray box with a driver seat in it.\
\
==Advantages==\
*Insanely overpowered, able to kill [[Prototype X-1]] and [[Prototype X-2]] without falling below 6k shield.\
*Insane alpha damage. Tyrant Cannon is able to do almost 4k damage against a hulled Super Capital.\
*Insanely high health. Only [[Subjugator]] with ShieldSides is able to beat Tyrant in health.\
*Nobody would dare to fight this ship with anything larger than a Battleship.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Cannot fire all its turrets unless it is facing its enemy, making Tyrant lose a big chunk of its DPS in actual battles.\
*Incredibly inaccurate turrets, as they can miss even when fighting against a Super Capital.\
*Swarms are the biggest counter to a Tyrant.\
*Sluggish like almost all other Super Capitals.\
\
==Strategy==\
*Nobody would dare to fight against a Tyrant in anything larger than a Battleship. If there are foolish people who oppose the Tyrant with large ships, atomize them with its bullishly overpowered DPS.\
*A Tyrant is able to take out 2 Super Capitals at once, but 3 or more Super Capitals would spell its demise.\
*3 very high firepower Dreadnoughts such as [[Retro Prototype X-1]] and [[Osiris]] are able to barely kill a Tyrant if the Tyrant takes the nuke damage.\
*Tyrant struggle greatly to hit anything smaller than a Battleship. Think before warping into a swarm of small ships.\
==Version History==\
*Added in an unknown version in Beta as an admin exclusive testing ship.\
*Removed in an unknown version in Beta.\
==Trivia==\
*This ship was added to the game for a while as a test ship exclusive to admins.\
*The Tyrant ended up being scrapped and never released to the public.\
*One of the few ships that can 1v1 an [[Eradicator]] and win.\

==Description==\
The '''''Zodiac''''' is a dark navy, box-like ship with blue neon lights outlining its features. It is the only regular build menu ship that requires [[Alien Part]]s to build, however has a strong loadout that also has surprisingly long range. It bears a strong aesthetic resemblance to precursor ships like the [[Astaroth]] and [[Azreal]], while maintaining a style similar to conventional ships.\
==Advantages==\
*Turrets have long range of 6650 studs.\
*High alpha damage.\
*Very cheap, considering its strength.\
*Somewhat accurate turrets, especially against slower moving targets.\
*High total health pool.\
*Good damage to both hull and shield.\
*Decent speed.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Horrendous acceleration.\
*Hard to hit small ships from a long range.\
*Turrets have long reload time.\
*Main source of shield damage requires good spinal aim.\
==Strategy==\
*Plays much more like a battlecruiser than a cruiser.\
*Use in swarms against larger ships for greater damage.\
*Pair up with a shield-breaker to maximize your combat effectiveness.\
*Get to max speed before warping into a fight so you don't take damage while accelerating.\
*Take advantage of the long range on your turrets to keep out of the thick of firefights that could be hazardous to this ship.\
==Version History==\
*No logged changes (?)\
==Trivia== \
*Has the Vanguard Coalition logo on the side of the engine.\
*The only non-limited/advanced cruiser to have custom turrets.\
*Due to the blue color scheme and precursor resemblance, the turret models are sometimes mistaken for the ones on the [[Azreal]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Pleasant Isle''' is a limited [[:Category:Battleship|'''Battleship''']] that was part of the 2022 Easter Event. It is a floating volcanic island with trees, grasses, and bodies of water, said water flowing off the edges in 3 channels.\
== Interior ==\
The '''Pleasant Isle's''' interior resembles that of the [[Judgement]], a small octagonal room with a pilot's chair and control panel. However, the walls are colored to a stone and dirt color. The monitor on the control panel has a picture of 3 Moai with bunny ears.\
== Advantages ==\
* High cargo hold for its class.\
* Absolutely shreds small [[ships]] with its PDLs and Flaks.\
*Turrets have a high rate of fire.\
*Decent maneuverability and speed\
*Good hull health.\
*🗿\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Hull-breakers like the [[Ridgebreaker]], [[Leviathan]], [[Hawklight]] and [[Borealis]] can easily destroy this ship, or force it to retreat.\
* Will be hunted, due to it being a limited ship.\
*Max turret range is very small for a ship its class.\
*Volcano can act as an obstruction for the turrets' line of sight.\
*Area below the main island is a blindspot that can be abused if the pilot does not use the '''Pleasant Isle's''' maneuverability to their advantage. (All turrets mounted on the top)\
== Strategy ==\
* Treat it like a trophy ship, as it is limited.\
* This ship is best suited for [[Archetypes|pest control]] and [[Archetypes|fleet support]] if used, as its turrets have a good fire rate, accuracy, and damage output.\
* Pitch slightly downwards to overcome the Volcano's blindspot.\
\
== Version History ==\
\
* Explosion size 100 ----> 400 .75a12\
\
== Trivia ==\
* All of the turrets have a sped-up Vine Boom sound effect when shot.\
*The first person to lose a '''Pleasant Isle''' was xps_15 to abc123Austinp's [[Judgement]].\
*The turrets resemble the Moai found on Easter island.\
*Interior resembles that of the [[Judgement]], and may be a recolored copy of the Judgement's interior.\
*Costed a permit for a time during its event.\

==Description==\
The '''Lykos''' is a sleek, long PvP-Carrier with powerful turrets and spinals. It stands out among [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] with its high health and single fighter, making it comparable to [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]] in terms of firepower. This ship was originally going to be awarded to the first-place winner of the Galaxy Tournament, however after being inactive for the longest time, it was announced that the Tournament was no longer continuing. The '''Lykos '''and [[C Class]] will never be distributed or even added to the game.\
==Interior==\
The '''Lykos''' is intended to be a yacht, and as such features the most luxurious interior in galaxy: 2 bedrooms, a lounge, a command deck and a large control room.\
==Advantages==\
*Health comparable to a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]].\
*High top speed for its class.\
*Ludicrously powerful [[Spinals]].\
*Huge cargo hold.\
*High DPS.\
*All [[Spinals|Torpedoes]] fire at the same time.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
*Will be targeted in almost every battle due to being the rarest ship in the game.\
*Don't be fooled by the massive health pool; a fleet can easily wipe it out.\
==Strategy==\
*Don't use this for trading during war.\
*Travel with a large fleet at all times, and if in doubt do not use this ship.\
==Version History==\
*Removed in version .69a2, due to the cancellation of the tournament.\
==Trivia==\
*Only two people were going to own this ship; the 1st-place winner of the Galaxy Tournament, and the ship's creator, Bomb_pops.\
*In etymology, the ship's name '<nowiki/>'''Lykos'''<nowiki/>' comes from the Greek word '<nowiki/>''lykos''<nowiki/>', meaning wolf.\

==Description==\
The '''Nighthawk''' is a fighter similar to the [[Xenophile]] but with a focus on shield health rather than hull health. However, it is one of the slowest [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] in the game. It only spawns on the [[Frion I|Lucifer Station]].\
==Appearance ==\
Like all fighter class ships, the '''Nighthawk''' has little in the way of an interior.\
==Advantages==\
*Small ship, making it quite difficult to destroy.\
* Can assist in wearing down enemy shields.\
*Deadly in swarms.\
== Disadvantages==\
*[[Spinals]] do little damage to hull.\
*Low total health of 150, even [[Wasp]] can deal with this because Mining Lasers can attack other ships now and are shield based.\
*Only effective against shields.\
*Slow speed for a fighter.\
== Strategy==\
*Work with other Fighters to take down larger ships.\
*Use with other Fighters to distract a [[Starbase]]'s lasers in a siege.\
* Use its speed to scout a Starbase. You can jump out of the ship above the Starbase and stand inside and give information about ships and Starbase condition.\
*Avoid ships with high maneuverability or lots of small turrets. Ships like the [[Tempest]], [[Ampharos]] and most [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]] will easily take fighters down, especially at close range.\
==Version History==\
*Buffed in .75a3.\
*Remodeled in .64f.\
*Started spawning on [[Frion I|Frion I's]] Lucifer Station in an unknown version.\
*[[Shields|Shield]] increased from 50 to 125, [[Hull]] reduced from 150 to 25, Top Speed reduced to 170 and received a remodel in version .69a2.\
==Trivia==\
*Because of how rare it is to see these ships in [https://web.roblox.com/games/200330616/Galaxy# Galaxy], many players are surprised to know it still exists. It is only known to spawn inside the Hevnetier.\
*Used to spawn in Starbases until they started to only spawn [[Fury|Furies]].\
*Has 4 reskins in the form of 3 separate Fighters and 1 Admin Ship; [[Firehawk]], [[Bonehawk]], [[IceFyre]], and the [[Spectating Ship]].\

The '''''Phantom''''' is cheap '''[[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]]''' with powerful shield damage.\
== Description ==\
The Phantom usually is chosen as a secondary starter ship over the [[Corvid]]. It is good for staying at the side of ships or going on top of ships because its [[Turrets|Turret]] placement works poorly when chasing ships, or when exploiting blind spots. It has two [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] which can make up for the poor turret placement. The Phantom also has a health pool of 1150, with 900 [[Shields|Shield]] and 250 [[Hull]].\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the Phantom is surprisingly complex for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]]. Upon entering, you will be greeted with three chairs in front of you. On your right, a terminal encrypted with odd messages and such. At the cockpit, there is another terminal with a blank screen and the driver's chair.\
== Advantages ==\
* Somewhat cheap for a Destroyer.\
* Well defended underbelly.\
* [[Spinals]] can deal heavy damage to shields.\
* Decent health for a Destroyer.\
* Shreds shields.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Turret placement can make it hard for all turrets to target at once.\
* Can't do much damage against hull.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a health buff and nerf in an unknown version that buffed shields from 550 to 900, and nerfed hull from 550 to 200.\
== Trivia ==\
* The Phantom has changed very little since it was first added.\
* Whenever this is possible, this could be a miniature version of [[Zeus]] hence its stats and a contains all turrets and spinals with laser weaponry.\
* It Is a common starter ship for players starting to make combat ships.\
* Has a limited version, the [[Ghost of Christmas Death|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Ghost of Christmas Death</span>]].\

|description = ?}}\
==Description==\
The '''''Adversary''''' was the main boss (excluding the [[Avellian Stronghold]]) of the [[Christmas Event 2021]]. Like the rest of the [[Avellian]] fleet, it shares some design traits and armament with them, however the '''''Adversary''''' has a unique vertical design, similar to the [[Halkaryak]]. It is also the only [[Avellian]] ship (along with its playable counterpart, the [[Khapri]]) to be a shield-breaker instead of a hull-shredder.\
==Behavior==\
The '''''Adversary''''' spawned roughly two hours into a round, with no player requirement. When spawned, it was announced at the top of the screen like other bosses. Upon being attacked, the '''''Adversary''''' called all other alien ships to its location. During battle, it tended to hover in place, being able to shoot its enemy from all angles using its superior line-of-sight.\
==Strategy==\
* Although the '''''Adversary''''' has forward-facing weaponry, its turrets can rotate to fire behind and to the sides of it as well. Because of this, the ship has no effective blindspot, so attempting to abuse this strategy proves fatal.\
* Gather a fleet of hull tanks in order to shrug off the blasts of the '''''Adversary''''', however take caution to not be destroyed by the hull-shredding armament of the '''''Adversary's''''' fleet: bring some strong AA ships such as the [[Tempest]] to pick off the smaller ships.\
* The most popular strategy for killing the '''''Adversary''''' was simply to draw it to a high-level [[Starbase]] with a fast ship and draw the fleet's fire while the base destroyed them.\
==Loot==\
\
* Drops 80 Snowflakes, 6 Plasma Batteries and 135 Alien Parts.\
==Trivia==\
* Considered to be the easiest event boss due to its measly health and damage when compared to other event bosses such as the [[Harvest King]] or [[Hellkeeper]].\
*Briefly used the model of the [[Mantid]] before it was changed to the [[Khapri]] because \"Mantid doesn't really look like a boss\".\
**It can be assumed '''''Adversary'''''<nowiki/>'s loadout was that of the [[Mantid|Mantid's]] during this period.\

==Description==\
The Flea is a seemingly more powerful version of the [[Alien Scout|Scout]], a ship in the [[Avellian]] Fleet. It boasts strong turrets with long range and a spinal loadout of 2 Medium [[Spinal Weaponry|Torpedoes]].\
==Interior==\
The interior is nothing more than a box with a pilot seat.\
==Advantages==\
* Good for torpedo sieging enemy bases.\
*High spinal damage output, capable of doing massive amount of hull damage at once.\
* Turrets have high alpha damage and long range.\
* Decent maneuverability.\
* Extremely high health for its class.\
* Very small profile.\
==Disadvantages==\
* When you try to jump out of the Flea to despawn it, you fall through the floor. Which might cause you to lose this ship.\
*Difficult to hit both turrets and torpedoes on small, moving targets.\
* Turrets have long reload times.\
* Lopsided health pool.\
* Torpedoes do not fire together.\
* Terrible acceleration.\
==Strategy==\
* Use your speed, size and health to kite larger ships while continuously slamming them with torpedoes.\
* Speed up to top speed before warping in order to come out of warp at full speed, avoiding the need to take hits while waiting for this ship to slowly climb to max speed in battle.\
==Version History==\
* Basic interior added in .75a3.\
* Removed from the game in version .75a10('''?''') due to archived meshes (broken visual model).\
==Trivia==\
* It's description is a Base64 encryption that translates to “From beyond light comes the blessing of decay“. Shares this description with the ship it also shares a model with, the [[Scout]].\
*The text \"FLEA\" on one side of the ship is mirrored on the other, reading \"AELF\" instead.\

==Description==\
The '''Patriotic Viper''' is a red, white, and blue recolor of the regular [[Viper]]. It has a glowing orange trail and a noticeable orange ball on the front of it, which is its own unique torpedo similar to the Hyperion's.\
==Interior==\
The '''Patriotic Viper''' has the same interior as its base ship, the [[Viper]]. The simple seat is still team-colored, and the rest of the cockpit remains gray.\
==Advantages==\
* Fast speed makes it hard for spinals/turrets to hit you.\
* Higher shield than the [[Viper]].\
* Insanely powerful spinals for its size, torpedo does ~ 300 damage.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Will be a prime target for Pirates.\
==Strategy==\
* Use the '''Patriotic Viper's''' high speed to avoid enemy fire.\
* Swarm with the '''Patriotic Viper''' for insane damage output in a short amount of time.\
==Version History==\
*Added in version .65b on July 5th as part of the [[:Category:Fourth of July 2019|2019 Fourth of July]] event.\
*Was re-released during the [[:Category:Fourth of July 2020|2020 Fourth of July]] event.\
*Was re-released again in the [[:Category:Fourth of July 2021|2021 Fourth of July]] event.\
*Speed increased from 280 to 290 in an unknown version.\
*1 Small Torpedo buffed to 4 Small Torpedoes, speed nerfed from 290 to 280, and turnspeed nerfed from 0.56 to 0.45 in version .72f\
*4 Small Torpedoes nerfed to 2 Small Torpedoes in version .72f1(this update was not mentioned anywhere).\
*Was removed in an unknown version\
==Trivia==\
* The first '''Patriotic Viper''' to be destroyed was CVN83's to aaron9566.\
* The '''Patriotic Viper's''' torpedo has a fire trail attached to it, making it very similar to the [[Hyperion]]'s torpedo.\

== Description ==\
The '''Sanguine''' is a large and powerful [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] with a well-decorated interior, previously spawned only in the [[Sakala]]. Though it is technically a fighter by its reliance on Carriers for deployment and warp capabilities, it has the health and firepower of a Cruiser or Battlecruiser class warship.\
\
== Appearance ==\
???\
\
== Advantages ==\
* Very high firepower for a Fighter.\
* High health for a Fighter.\
* Good assortment of [[Turrets]].\
* No blind spots.\
* Can take on Battlecruisers and below if both are deployed.\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* The slowest Fighter, having 40 less top speed than the [[Elanis]] and [[Harbinger]].\
* Poor maneuverability, especially for a Fighter.\
* Large for a Fighter and easy to hit (It is the size of a cruiser).\
\
* No [[Warp Drive]].\
\
== Strategy ==\
* Can be used to support a fleet, but can't hold its own in a fight.\
* Good against [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]] or other Fighters smaller than it, but is unable to combat larger ships on its own.\
* Use in swarms and with other ships to create a powerful force.\
\
== Version History ==\
* Received a nerf to its shield health in version ???\
* Received a \"retro\" remodel inspired by the Gargoyle from Star Conflict in version .64c.\
* The [[Sakala]]'s fighters were replaced with [[Firehawk|Firehawks]] in .65a, making this ship unavailable to normal players.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* In order to exit the Sakala's original hangar, this fighter needed to drop downwards.\
* [[File:Sanguine hangar.png|thumb|220x220px|An old sanguine in the hangar of the original Sakala model.]]The ship does not change color to indicate your team as all others do. Instead, it always remains a glowing golden.\
* The old model had a ladder on the side of the ship that is necessary to enter it while docked in the hangar. It shared much in common with the destroyer-class [[Chimera]].\
* Large for its class.\

==Description==\
A large warship designed to siege bases from afar, this ship is a force to be reckoned with, but can still be brought down by skilled pilots.\
==Interior==\
The interior consists of a simple empty room with a chair on an elevated platform and a control panel in the front with a lot of buttons.\
==Advantages==\
* Has advantages similar to its normal counterpart (the [[Ridgebreaker]]).\
* Has a large Cargo Hold.\
* Much more balanced, and increased firepower compared to its normal counterpart.\
* Slightly better acceleration compared to its normal counterpart.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Easily swarmed by small ships.\
* Large blind spot on the underbelly and back.\
* Somewhat inaccurate turrets.\
*Very expensive, as it is semi-Limited.\
==Strategy==\
* The [[Turrets|Railguns]] and [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] add up to create an immense amount of hull damage. Though this is a limited ship, so watch out and be careful with it.\
* Outrange the heavy laser armament on [[Starbase]]s with your [[Turrets|Retro Medium Railguns]].\
==Version History==\
* Added in .66b, along with the retro ship event.\
* Received a buff along with all other retro event ships in .66b shortly after the event ended.\
* Shield health increased from 8,725 to 9,000, an additional 2 Heavy Lasers added(2 Retro Heavy Lasers -> 4 Retro Heavy Lasers), and 2 more Huge Cannon spinals added(4 Huge Cannons -> 6 Huge Cannons) in version .75a5.\
*Explosion Size 180 ----> 900 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
* It's the original model that was introduced in early beta.\
*Compared to its regular counterpart, the Retro Ridgebreaker is much smaller.\

==Description==\
The '''Acolyte''' is a medium-sized Battlecruiser with decent speed, good mobility, and a high health pool. It has a visually appealing exterior with a unique design and details all over the ship. \
\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Acolyte''' has a decently detailed interior, including a single co-pilot seat and an orange projection that serves as a display. The contents of the display relate to the systems and condition of the ship for the most part, with the center of the display reading, \"ACOLYTE UNLEASHED\".  \
\
==Advantages==\
*High health for a Battlecruiser.\
*Fast speed for a Battlecruiser.\
*Powerful spinals.\
*All turrets do good shield damage.\
*Highest acceleration of its class, 5 higher acceleration then the [[Zhen]].\
\
==Disadvantages==\
* Very expensive for a Battlecruiser, requiring 100,000 credits and gamma/void pumpkins.\
* The hull damage relies on the cannon spinals, meaning you have to hit the spinals for balanced shield and hull damage.\
*Slightly bad turret placement.\
\
==Strategy==\
\
* Have the front of the ship face the center of the target from at least 2k studs away so that all of the turrets are able to fire.\
* For hulled targets, prioritize landing your large cannons, as the turrets deal bad hull damage.\
\
==Version History==\
*No logged changes.\
\
==Trivia==\
\
* The name of the ship is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acolyte word] that refers to an assistant or follower of a religious member or leader.\
** Fittingly, it was obtained from a quest in which you fetch items for what was presumably some sort of deity.\
* You can look out through the front of the ship from the interior.\

\
== Advantages ==\
\
*Very fast.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
\
\
* Only 1 [[Shields|Shield]]-breaking [[Turrets|Turret]] means that it has trouble against [[Hull]]-based ships such as the [[Invictus]].\

==Description==\
The '''Sentinel''' is a fast Cruiser equipped with decently powerful [[Spinals]]. It has some, but not great [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower. It has average health for its class. The '''Sentinel''' has a unique shape to it, resembling some sort of weirdly formed pancake in a sense.\
==Interior==\
The interior is pretty much nonexistent.\
==Advantages==\
*High [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower.\
*Cheap.\
*Quite durable.\
*Good turn speed.\
*High health.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Low [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
*Relatively big for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].\
*Somewhat large frame, which makes it more vulnerable to lower-accuracy weaponry.\
==Strategy==\
*Avoid being in the enemy line of fire and use your speed as an advantage.\
*Use the Phasers to wear down the enemy's shield, then use your Turrets and Cannon to destroy their [[hull]].\
*The high cargo and cheap price make it a good pirating ship for newer players with generally lower income.\
==Version History==\
*Deleted from the game in ???\
*Re-added to the game, received a remodel and loadout changed from 2 Light Gatling Lasers, 2 Light Gatling Cannons, 1 medium railgun(turrets), 4 Small Phasers, and 1 Medium Cannon(spinal) to 2 Light Lasers, 1 Light Cannon, 1 Medium Cannon for turrets; and 7 Small Phasers for spinals in version .73d6.\
==Trivia==\
*Based on its name, it should be used for defense.\
*Getting to the seat of the ship may be confusing at first due to no obvious points of entry.\
*Was the first non-fighter class ship to be legitimately deleted from the game, until it returned after over 1 year of being disabled.\

The '''Icicle''' is a winter-themed Battlecruiser from the 1st stage of the 2019 Christmas Event. It bears two large icicle-like prongs with a set of three glowing pale blue orbs suspended between them. The rear of the ship sports two sets of three thrusters, while the central area is covered with various decorative plates and snowflake emblems.\
\
== Appearance ==\
You enter through a hatch/teleporter on the aft end of the ship. on the inside is a ladder (the way out), and small details in front of the driving seat, the details include 3 cyan panels/screens.

== Advantages ==\
* Good [[Hull]] for a Battlecruiser.\
* Decent Speed.\
* Relatively cheap.\
* Hull breaker turrets.\
\

\
== Strategy ==\
* Try to achieve kills quickly, as it has low Shields and you will get targeted if enemies see this ship hulled.\
* Use this ship the same way you would use an [[Arthur]], as it has basically the same weapon layout, with Shield-breaking [[Spinals]] and Hull-breaking [[Turrets]].\
\
== Version History ==\
*Shield health increased to 2000, Phasers resized to large, cannons re-classed as railguns in version .72f\
== Trivia ==\
* Players were required to kill [[Aliens]] in order to get the [[Snowflake]]s used to build this Ship.\

<h1>Xeiron Industries</h1>'''Xeiron Industries''' was a manufacturing company formed in the early days of the Interstellar Space Program. They quickly grew due to the popularity and efficiency of their advanced power systems, most of which were necessary for any interstellar spacecraft. Being one of the oldest companies on Earth that still exists, Xeiron ascended to the stars along with the rest of humanity, becoming one of the first private industries to reach the so-called “final frontier.” Though the company was originally founded to create specialized components for the I.S.P., they later began to delve into designing their own spacecraft.\
[[File:XeironLogo2.png|centre|thumb|432x432px|The Logo of Xeiron Industries]]Xeiron Industries built ships such as Dreadnoughts and Battlecruisers to aid military expeditions into the great unknown. Typically, their ships had the majority of their power routed to one primary system. Their emblem was usually emblazoned on or inside the ship. As they continued producing ships, they delve into much more experimental designs such as so-called “Titan” class. Unfortunately, the massive production cost and incredible amounts of energy required to run Titan-class ships, as well as many problems with construction, meant the project was postponed indefinitely. They also had similar issues with ships such as their Heavy Carrier and Fighters. Eventually, they started selling mass-producible, specialized ships at cheaper costs, taking advantage of their heavy manufacturing industry.\
During the development of their heavier ships, Xerion Industries started investing into reactor research at the newly built Sambhyre Station. The station was originally designed to help create new, high-power fuels with base ingredients such as Iridium and Uranium. During research phases, one of the employees started trading the technology and fuel to other companies for profit, but a faulty storage container in the employee's locker caused a massive energy leak, leading to dangerous instabilities in the station's main reactor. The station was placed on automated lockdown, and every crew member was hastily evacuated before the station nearly ripped itself apart. \
\
The station now lies Derelict, but its reactor is still active. With no motivation in Xerion to keep the research open after the failure of the Titans, the company has kept a contract open to all traders and miners in the region to supply and maintain the station for a small cash bonus.\
\
During the years of the Kneall threat, they supplied weapons and parts to the U.N.E and many other militaristic companies and factions required to fight off any approaching aliens. \

==Description==\
The '''Hallow''' is a fast and slim ship which resembles the [[Zhen]], as both ships are flat and have mainly spinal-based firepower.\
==Advantages==\
*Very good shield health, rivaling some [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
*Powerful [[Spinals]].\
*Very fast.\
*Some [[Turrets]] will have trouble hitting this ship.\
*Very powerful in Groups/Swarms with good coordination, allowing it to defeat strong ships like the [[Consul]].\
*Very hard to hit with spinals when at full speed.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Will be hunted due to it being a limited ship.\
*Very expensive compared to other Battlecruisers.\
*Requires good spinal aim.\
==Strategy==\
*Use your speed to avoid other [[Ships]]<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[Turrets]] while you hit them with your Spinals.\
*It could also be used to distract Starbases due to its speed, shape, and health.\
*Play this ship like the [[Razor Wing]], it can take down stronger Ships.\
*Make sure to use the Q and E keys to drift and constantly fire your Spinals.\
*Stay about 2k studs away from the enemy ship when PvPing so you can fire your [[Spinals]] accurately.\
\
* Effective in swarms.\
* Use in hit-and-run tactics.\
\
==Version History==\
*Received a remodel in version .66m\
*Saying \":Cost Hallow\" started showing the cost for this ship in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* Before the bug got fixed in an unknown version, \":Cost '''Hallow'''\" would only show the cost for the [[Hallowlight]], this means it cannot be refunded before it got fixed, this has since been patched and now shows the cost for '''Hallow'''.\
* Widely considered \"OP\" by players.\
* Accidentally given 6/6 huges for 10 minutes (these are the spinals of the Prototype X-2)\
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a D class permit (675k credits) + 2327 Sillicate, 1843 Carbon, 1272 Iridium, 14 Adamantite, 58 Palladium, 20 Titanium, and 20 Quantium\

==Description==\
The '''Retro Centurion '''is a limited version of the original [[Centurion]], featuring the ship's original model and a significantly more powerful weapon loadout.\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Retro Centurion '''is made up of two rooms, with one room being a small bedroom with bunk beds, and the other room containing the pilot's seat. Both of these rooms are connected by a short hallway.\
==Advantages==\
* Devastating [[Hull]] damage output.\
* High health for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
* Has a [[Spinal Weaponry|Medium Torpedo]], making this ship a good early torpedo sieger.\
* [[Turrets|Retro Light Flak Cannons]] provide some protection against small ships.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Below average [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
* Landing the [[Spinals|Torpedo]] in combat may be difficult.\
* Rather slow for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
* Expensive for a ship of its class.\
* Large profile for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]], especially broadside, making it easy to hit.\
* Will be targeted more due to it being a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ship.\
== Strategy ==\
*Use your medium [[Spinal Weaponry|Torpedo]] to siege bases from a distance (10k).\
*Make sure a fleet is protecting you during a siege.\
*In combat, try to land your [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]]; they account for a huge portion of the ship's DPS.\
*Avoid ships with high-accuracy [[Turrets]] like the [[Ampharos]], as they will shred you.\
*Finish off crippled targets with your high hull damage.\
==Version History==\
*No logged changes.\
==Trivia==\
* Has blast wings attached to the side of its thrusters, unlike the current [[Centurion]] model.\
* Has a pitiful explosion radius of 1.__NOTOC__\
* Is capable of soloing a [[Galleon]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Interceptor''' previously spawned on the [[Nimitz]] and is one of few fighters that spawn with a[[Turrets| Turret]] instead of spinal weaponry. The '''Interceptor''' can spawn with either a Medium Laser (S) or a Medium Flak Cannon (H). Currently it does not spawn in game normally, with the 13 '''Interceptors''' normally spawning on the [[Nimitz]] bring replaced by 3 Instigators, 3 Interceptor H-s, and 7 Foxfires. \
\
== Appearance ==\
Like all fighter class ships, the '''Interceptor''' has little in the way of an interior.\
\
== Advantages ==\
* It has a [[Turrets|Turret]], unlike most [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* Can quickly overwhelm ships in numbers.\
* In large numbers, the amount of turrets of the combined forces can overwhelm other ships.\
* It has decent health for a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]],\
* Moderately accurate turrets allow the ship to combat moth large and small ships.\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
\
* [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]] miss smaller [[Ships]] more often.\
\
== Strategy ==\
* Make sure your team is in a bunch of these and aim at the same ship.\
* Always go under a ship.\
* Swarming with all [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] from [[Nimitz]] creates huge damage comparable to a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] or some [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
* Good for warding off enemy scouts. Additionally, it can defend from [[Aliens]] when no one else is available.\
\
== Version History ==\
* Small Flak Cannon replaced with Medium Flak Cannon / Light Laser replaced with Medium Laser in .61g.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* These two [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] originally spawned in the [[Nimitz]].\
* Previously the only fighter to spawn in level 3 [[Starbase]]s. This was changed in a sub-version of update .61 that changed the [[Starbase]] design.\
* Both S and H are the only Fighters to have a flag.\
* American flags on the nose of the fighters pay homage to the US supercarrier from which the Interceptors' carrier, the [[Nimitz]], gets its name. \
* No longer spawns in game after being replaced by 3 new fighter types on the [[Nimitz]]. \

== Advantages ==\
* Very High mobility.\
* Decent for distracting a base during a siege.\

== Disadvantages ==\
* Low health.\
* No [[Shields|Shield]] breaking weapons.\
* Rather slow Acceleration.\

* Used in the featured teaser image on the Roblox game page, along with the [http://roblox-galaxy-official.wikia.com/wiki/Spectre Spectre] and [http://roblox-galaxy-official.wikia.com/wiki/Warlock Warlock].\
* Common starter ship.\
* Well known for being very old.\
* The version of the '''Archangel''' added in-game on March 25th, 2017 [update version unsure] was an older build of the ship that was later replaced?\

==Description==\
The '''Ishkur''' is a small [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]]. To enter, players simply jump into the black area inside of it. It has a decent health pool for its class and, like most [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]], is only armed with [[Spinals|Spinal weaponry]].\
\
The exterior design features a long pole that looks very similar to a weapon used for jousting. The shape of the cockpit area and the small handle-like attachment behind the pilot's seat mimics a horse saddle, further connecting the ship with the medieval competition of jousting.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Ishkur''' has no interior. Almost the entire space that could be devoted to interior decoration is instead covered up by a dark black block that conceals the pilot.\
==Advantages==\
* Balanced [[Spinals]].\
* Cheap.\
* Fast.\
* Teaches newer players how to use [[Spinals]] more effectively.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Fairly low overall damage.\
* Terrible Acceleration, having half the acceleration value of the [[E Class]].\
* Slow Turn Speed.\
* No [[Turrets]].\
* [[Spinals]] fire one after the other, making them hard to aim to hit fast targets.\
* Requires good spinal aim.\
==Strategy==\
* Useful for getting under [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and annoying them. Also decent for low loyalty [[Pirating]].\
* High speed and decent health makes it effective in attacking many large [[ships]].\
==Version History==\
*The ship received a major nerf in .62d7 that lowered its [[Shields|Shield]]/[[Hull]] from 450/450 to 290/290. This change also lowered the explosive range from 45 to 2, although its explosive damage remains the same.\
==Trivia==\
* The model was loosely based off an EVE online ship of [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ishkur the same name].\
* The rear thrusters look like 4 legs.\

The '''UNE Subjugator''' is a passive, [[U.N.E]] affiliated ship that is the equivalent of a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] and one of the tankiest ships in the game at a total health of 35000 and 65% damage resistance. \
\
Only a maximum of 2 spawns in a public server.\
==Behavior==\
It is seen and spawns at the [[Mega Base]] guarding it and It will attack [[Aliens|Alien]] and [[Pirates|Pirate]] ships if they get too close. It is able to call other U.N.E. ships to assist it in combat, similar to a [[Punisher]]. \
\
It will leave it's guarding post to respond to other [[U.N.E]] ships' call for aid. Once the target is destroyed, it will return to [[Mega Base]].\
\
'''Note''': UNE Subjugator, along with all other [[U.N.E]] ships do not spawn in private servers.\
==Strategy==\
*Lure powerful enemy AI ships such as the [[Kodiak]] or [[Decimator]] to it, as the UNE Subjugator will always win the battle due to it being extremely tanky and having an allied fleet supporting it from its call ability.\
\
*Be sure to warp away as far as possible as when it's somehow destroyed, it will leave a '''10k Stud nuke''', dealing tremendous amounts of damage to any ship close it.\
==Version History==\
*Added in version 69f.\
*Spawned naturally along with other [[U.N.E]] capital ships during the [[Kneall Event]] in version .75a10\
*Disabled from spawning naturally due to the conclusion of the [[Kneall Event]] in version .75a11\
==Trivia==\
*Even though it has 2 [[ShieldSide]], these never spawn unlike the player-owned [[Subjugator]].\

*The largest passive AI Ship in the game.\

==Description==\
The '''Outrider''' is an enemy AI ship that was first added as part of the Kneall fleet added in the Alien AI update, along with a few others (like the [[Kneall Bruiser|Bruiser]] and [[Kneall Scout|Scout]]). It is the [[Aliens|Alien]] equivalent of a [[:category:cruiser|Cruiser]].\
==Behavior==\
'''Outriders''' behave almost the same as [[Swarmer]]s. They tend to stay around 3 to 3.5k studs from whatever they are attacking and may move below [[Ships]] to maintain turret line of sight.\
\
When the Kneall Fleet is spawned, '''Outriders''' are spawned with it. They will always answer a [[Punisher]]'s call for help once spawned. They will scatter once the target they have been called to is destroyed.\
\
Just like all other [[Aliens]], swarms of '''Outriders''' are easily able to destroy Starbases, even the most defended. They are not to be underestimated in a 1 versus 1 fight, as they can destroy the strongest cruisers, and even some weak Battlecruisers. Do not underestimate their insane weapon range compared to similarly classed player ships.\
==Strategy==\
Due to having cruiser size, they are best fought off using [[Ships]] with high accuracy turrets.\
\
Their size also allows players to try and brute force the kill with a battlecruiser or battleship, as high accuracy weapons aren't necessary. \
==Loot==\
Outrider wrecks give 50 Alien Parts.\
==Version History==\
*Renamed from '''Kneall Outrider''' to '''Outrider''' in version .69d2\
==Trivia==\
* Images of this ship could be found months before the update in the [https://discord.robloxgalaxy.wiki/|Galaxy Discord]'s ship building hangar, and much earlier on the Mega Base's monitors for news broadcasts.\
* You can see the remains of a crashed Kneall outrider near the remains of U.N.E. Base 12.\
* The Outrider looks like the Specter from Galaxy on Fire 2.\
*There can only be 5 Outriders spawned in a server at any time.\

It has a brighter brown-gold color scheme, as opposed to the dark brown coloring of the player-owned Nidhogg. This ship also has more health and firepower than the Nidhogg, likely resulting in its Battlecruiser classification rather than inheriting the Nidhogg's Cruiser classification.\

*Use a ship with powerful and accurate [[:Category:Hull breaker|Hull-breaking]] [[turrets]] to defeat this ship as it is small and has little shields\
==Version History==\
*Removed from build menu on June 2nd, 2021 (version .72e1)\
*Originally called Hijacked Nidhogg. Was renamed when re-added to game as an NPC ship to prevent people who bought it from being able to use it.\
*Spinal count doubled from 1 set of 5 Medium Phasers to two sets in version .72e1.\
*Credit yield increased to 10,000 credits in version .72e1.\
*Spinal count reduced back to 1 set of 5 Medium Phasers in version .72e1.\
*Loadout changed from 3 Dual Medium Cannons to 1 Dual Medium Cannon and 2 Medium Flak Cannons, spinals changed from 1 set of 5 Medium Phasers to 2 sets of 2 Medium Phasers in version .72e1.\
==Trivia==\
*Cannot be spawned in and will show up red in your ship inventory.\
*This ship was accidentally released to the on build menu on June 2nd, 2021.\
**The ship was worth approximately 12,000-16,394 [[Credits]] during this time.\

== Description ==\
The '''Python''' is a Frigate Class ship. It has two [[Spinals|Small Phasers]], two [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannons]], two [[Turrets|Light Gatling Lasers]], and decent maneuverability. It has a recognizable trapezoidal shape and can easily be picked out among other ships.\
== Appearance ==\
A teleporter in the middle of a hallway: behind the teleporter is a Cobra Imperium logo, in front is where the seat is, along with multiple graphic interfaces and buttons near the seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Speedy.\
* Cheap.\
* Can wear down shields quickly, with twice the firepower of the [[Raven]] and the [[Avenger]].\
* Great support ship.\
*  Has a high amount of turrets for a frigate\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low health.\
* Low hull damage.\
* Rather large for a [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]].\
* Not a good solo ship.\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship does not do well alone. But in a fleet, you can quickly wear down an opponent's shields while they are distracted by the larger ships in your fleet.\
* Try to stay in the blind spots of enemy ships by using your superior agility so they cannot fire back at you.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a buff in version .61g adding its turrets.\
* Received 2 Small Cannons (\"G\" Spinal) and Turn speed increased from 0.6 to 0.7 in version .65b.\
* It's 2 Small Cannons were removed, one of its light lasers were swapped with a Light Flak Cannon, and it was given 2 Light Gatling Lasers in version .66b.\
== Trivia ==\
* This was originally going to be a [[Constellation]] model, but then Iamawesome315 reshaped it and scaled it down into a python.\
* It has a Cobra Imperium logo in it, and next to it are some scattered papers, one of which has Iamawesome315's character on it.\
* Closely resembles a guitar pick.\

== Description ==\
The '''Tempura''' is a cheap and small [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] with triple the Cargo Hold of the starter trade ship, the [[Wyrm]]. It is useful for cheap trading and scavenging. Its relatively high maneuverability makes it good for looting and escaping, though its health is rather low.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Tempura's''' interior is quite large for a [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] its size. The entrance contains the cockpit with a control panel and doorway to the engine room, which has assorted boxes and the engine.\
== Advantages ==\
* Easy to obtain. \
\
* Moderate Speed.\
* Better than the [[Wyrm]] across nearly all stats.\
* Very cheap.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low Cargo Hold in comparison to other Freighters.\
* Low [[Hull]] and [[Shields]], making it easy to destroy.\
== Strategy ==\
* It is recommended that you get this after the [[Wyrm]], however, you can also choose to skip this in favor of [[Argonaut]] due to its higher capacity for a negligible speed decrease.\
* Make sure to trade in a [[Factions|Faction]] that is in no wars and has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have [[War]]s, try your best to be safe.\
* Go to the [[Mega Base]] when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a war. There might be a [[Pirating|Pirate]] waiting for you.\
* Check how far away the closest [[Aliens|Alien]] is and where it is heading.\
* Go to high-ore wrecks and head to [[Mega Base]] or your base for a good profit.\
==Version History==\
* Received a buff in .61e4 that doubled [[Hull]] and [[Shields]] and gave the ship ''some ''damage resistance.\
* Cargo Hold buffed in .65b from 500 to 750, price increased slightly.\
== Trivia ==\
* In etymology, the '''Tempura''' is named after a Japanese seafood dish and is also another name for the \"Prawn\".\

== Description ==\
The '''Hyron '''is a light, yet strong Battlecruiser. It is used solely for taking down [[Swarmer]]s or other light ships. It is defenseless against more substantial ships.\

The interior is very unique; it is bright and heavenly with a huge white screen as a navigation system for the pilot to use. The display of the interior is quite small and not easy to fit in, but has a very nice polish of smooth edges and parts to make it look good.\
== Advantages ==\
* Fast for its class.\
* Great against smaller ships.\
* Has decent health for its purpose.\
* Has no blind spots. No ship can evade at least one turret.\
* Cheap for its turret firepower.\
* One of the fastest [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] in the game.\
*Has good total turret '''DPS''' for a battlecruiser of '''138'''.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* DPS is more centered towards taking down light destroyers, frigates and fighters. Not great against larger ships.\
\
* Requires pinpoint maneuvering to aim all [[Turrets]]\
* Has a small Cargo Hold for a supposed research ship.\
== Strategy ==\
* Do not use this ship head-on against a skilled pilot, especially if the opposing ship has spinals or is Battlecruiser-class and above.\
* Stay at a distance if you are not skilled with close-combat.\
* Use it as AA in a siege group, just one AA ship ( like the '''Hyron''' ) can go a long way.\
* When attacking ships, begin by angling downward from them to allow the [[Turrets|Gatling Lasers]] to fire - then, when the opponent is hulled, angle upwards to allow the medium flak to hit.\
== Version History ==\
* No logged changes?                     (Its off sale why is it not fixed yet?)\
== Trivia ==\
* If you look closely at the screen in front of the pilot seat, you can see a picture of Jeff Bezos.\

\
The '''Interior''' is a simple grey box with the seat in the center; It is located on the back of the ship.\
==Advantages ==\
*Good overall [[Galaxy Slang|Hull DPS]], at 350. \
\
*Very maneuverable for a dreadnought with decent turn speed and acceleration\
\
* Decently high, [[Galaxy Slang|Balanced]] health pool across [[Shields]] and [[Hull]] \
\
*Only one [[Galaxy Slang|blind-spot]] around the back\
==Disadvantages==\
*On the weaker side of firepower against [[Shields]].\
\
*Struggles to fire all turrets at once, unless pointing directly at its target.\

*A large size allows the enemy to hit you much more consistently with spinals.\
\
*Most expensive ship in the Halloween 2021 event: (1.1M Credits, 550 Souls, 40 Forgotten Souls).\
==Strategy==\
*Do not bring this ship to battle unless you are confident you won't be [[Galaxy Slang|Dived]].  \

== '''Description''' ==\
[[File:Avellian Stronghold-icon.png|right|frameless]]\
The '''Avellian Starbase''' (also known as the '''Stronghold''') is a randomly spawning alien starbase added during the [[Christmas Event 2021|Christmas 2021]] event. The base has 22,500 Shield and 27,500 Hull, and is protected by periodically respawning Alien ODP (Orbital Defense Platforms) and has heavy defenses. Its range is approximately 7,200 studs, and has an unconfirmed DPS of 990. Many details are unknown of this object, but is confirmed to drop '''Blueprints''' when destroyed (along with other materials).\
When destroyed, it will explode, dealing damage to anything within an approximate 20k radius, the equivalent of the Mothership's explosion. This nuke is powerful enough to destroy battleships, and is more than capable of bringing a full health Prometheus to less than 5k HP left.\
=='''Strategy'''==\
*Use AA ships (Slipstream is recommended due to its tank) to kill the ODPs\
*The Stronghold has a large blindspot below where there is little firepower. Players can exploit it by bringing a high HP ship such as a [[Prometheus]], [[Hailstorm]] or [[Halkaryak]].\
*Torpedoes are very effective against the Stronghold as they allow the player to avoid the high DPS from the Stronghold's armament (AA ships are still required to kill the aliens and ODPs, unless the player is able to tank all of them)\
*Due to the Stronghold's relatively low range and massive blindspots, a [[Judgement]] can theoretically solo it, if the ODPs are cleared out and any aliens that attack the Judgement are destroyed\
*When the Avellian Stronghold starts dying, '''warp at least 26k studs away from it.''' Underestimating the nuke of the Stronghold has claimed the ships of many, so try not to make the same mistake.\
=='''Loot'''==\
The Stronghold drops the following loot:\
*350 Snowflakes\
*<s>1 Blueprint A</s> (Removed temporarily)\
*1 Blueprint B\
*50 Plasma Batteries\
The Alien ODP drops the following loot:\
*1 Snowflake\
*5 Armor Scraps\
The Alien H-ODP (Stronger ODP) drops the following loot:\
*11 Snowflakes\
*5 Armor Scraps\
=='''Trivia'''==\
*The explosion radius upon destruction of the Avellian Stronghold is estimated to be at, or in excess of 20,000 studs.\
*Avellian Stronghold nukes have claimed the ships of many, including TailsGamerTY's [[Lucifer]].\
*A Wasp can fit inside of the docking ports and can reach the invisible barrier. This usually won't help keep turrets from attacking other ships in a siege, but it can attract aliens from attacking other things, as the stronghold can't hit you from inside.\
*It is possible to get inside of the stronghold itself through one of the docking ports, which isn't completely blocked by the invisible barrier. It is also possible to warp inside of it with a small ship such as a Draco.\

==Description==\
The '''Zero''' has a decent amount of health, while also being fast and maneuvrable. It is very good for attacking larger ships from their blind-spots and killing fighters with its turrets and phasers. There are two gatling guns which can take on smaller ships. A very good starting warship.\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Zero''' consists only of a small pass-through cockpit window and a square acting as the pilot's seat.\
==Advantages ==\
*Fourth cheapest [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
*Powerful phasers, they can all fire together.\
*Good [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
==Disadvantages ==\
*Weak hull.\
*The [[Spinals]] fire in a horizontal line, making hitting small ships and aiming difficult.\
*Not as much DPS (damage per second) as the [[Cobra]].\
* Very weak turrets.\
* It will get melted by a Cobra or any other ships with a lot of phasers.\
*Rather slow for a [[Ships|Destroyer]].\
*Low [[Hull]] damage.\
==Strategy ==\
*Use this ships agility to attack Frigates and Fighters.\
*Send this ship out to destroy any attacking carriers fighters\
*Avoid ships with many small turrets such as the ampharos as they will shred you apart.\
*Use Q and E to tilt your ship to make sure the most spinals can hit.\
==Version History==\
*Remodeled in an unknown version.\
*Top speed reduced from 210 to 115, Turn Speed reduced from 0.63 to 0.5, 2 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] changed to 4 [[Spinals|Small Phasers]] and given a remodel in version .66b.\
== Trivia==\
* It docks the same way a [[Wasp]] does where you can just walk straight into the ship.\
*The Zero was for a brief time the only ship to have [[Cancelled Updates|Homing Missiles]] on it, but only in [[Galaxy Development]].\
*You can get the ship for free by using code \"SPACE\".\

The '''''Brawler''''' is a [[Kneall]] Battleship from the 2nd Part of the [[:Category:Halloween 2021|Halloween Event 2021]].\
==Description==\
The '''''Brawler''''' is a small battleship that functions similarly to its dreadnought counterpart, the [[Obliterator]]. As such, it is equipped with [[Kneall]] weaponry. \
\
\
==Interior==\
The interior is a simple, a cone-like room with a seat. It has barely enough space for the player.\
==Advantages==\
*High shields for a ship of its class.\
*Small profile and high speed.\
*Balanced firepower.\
*Turrets have high damage and are fast firing.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Expensive, also required an [[Alien Device]] (unobtainable through normal means during its event).\
*Low hull health.\
*Will be hunted due to being a limited ship.\
*Long spinal interval.\
*When running teleporter is hard to reach due to extremely small interior\
==Strategy==\
* Use this ship in battleship-to-battleship combat. Its small size and speed should help you avoid enemy fire, while you rip them apart with your rapid firing weaponry and spinals.\
*Make sure to retreat before your enemy can get you down to your hull.\
==Version History==\
* Added in Part 2 of [[:Category:Halloween 2021|Halloween 2021]].\
*Spinals upscaled from Medium Cannons and Phasers to Large Cannons and Phasers in an unknown version.\
*Explosion size 200 ----> 490 .75a12\
*Name changed Bioicle -> Brawler .75a37\
==Trivia==\
*Dubbed the \"Mini [[Obliterator]]\" by players, due to its appearance being similar.\
*One of the few playable ships of 100% Kneall design in-game, the others being the [[Prototype X-2]] and the [[Obliterator]].\
*This ship had a somewhat unreasonable cost, since alien devices were unobtainable during the event unless you already had one or the materials for one.\

==Description==\
The '''Snowsturm''' is a reskin of the [[Sturm]] that was introduced during part 2 of the '''Christmas 2020 Event'''.\
==Interior==\
Please document the interior if you own this ship.\
==Advantages==\
*Has one of the highest acceleration stats of any Battlecruiser, aside from the [[Zhen]] and [[Acolyte]].\
*Can deal massive damage if used correctly.\
*Second fastest [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] in the game, being beaten in speed only by the Zhen.\
*Powerful [[Spinals]].\
*Excellent mobility.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Low [[Shields]] and [[Hull]] for a Battlecruiser.\
*Despite its speed, it has a rather large size for a ship of its class.\
*Being able to aim with the ship's [[Spinals]] is crucial to do decent damage.\
*3rd most expensive Battlecruiser in the game, only cheaper than Zhen and Acolyte.\
*Larger than its [[Sturm|regular counterpart]], due to it using an older model.\
*Like many other quests, it can only be done once, so if you lose it, you can't get it back aside from refunds.\
==Strategy==\
\
* Treat it as you would any other limited ship, not using it often to avoid losing it.\
\
==Version History==\
*Shields increased from 1250 to 3000 and 2 [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]] replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Medium Ice Lasers]] in version .70a.\
== Trivia ==\
* This ship was<nowiki/> re-introduced during the [[Christmas Event 2021|2021 Christmas Event]].\
*The '''Snowsturm'''<nowiki/>'s stat distribution used to be the exact same as its regular counterpart, the [[Sturm]].\

==Description==\
The '''Nyxesion''' uses the old model of the [[Nixesion]], however it has modified stats compared to the mentioned ship.\
== Appearance==\
The Nyxesion is a small fighter that bears a resemblance to the [[Dragonfly]], with 4 wings on the back. \
\
Like all fighter class ships, the Nyxesion has little in the way of an '''Interior'''.\
==Advantages==\
*Spinal DPS of 102 can lead to a monstrous DPS of 1160 when all fighters are used.\
*Like with most fighters, small size.\
* Balanced [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] firepower.\
*Easy to control since it moves slow enough for the pilot to react.\
*A couple of '''Nyxesions''' can destroy a Level 1, 2 and even a level 3 or 4 [[Starbase]] if undefended.\
*Effective when used to swarm large [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], and [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]].\
*Just 2-3 can deal more damage than most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]\
==Disadvantages==\
*Somewhat slow for a fighter, still faster than the [[Nixesion]] though.\
*Can be shot down easily by Light Turrets.\
*No [[Turrets]].\
==Strategy == \
*Group together with your other Nyxesions, as all 12 in a swarm can bring as much destruction as a [[:Category:Prototype|Prototype]] ship.\
*Focus on swarming and destroying AA ships like the [[Ampharos]] or [[Hyron]] first, as they will shred you if left alone.\
*Use the ship's high maneuverability to get into the blind spots of larger ships and deal heavy spinal damage.\
==Version History==\
*Added to the game on version .73a3 along with [[Retro Nyx|the carrier]] that contains these ships.\
* Name changed from Retro Nixesion to '''Nyxesion''' in version .75a1.\
*Cannon and Phaser intervals changed from 0.15 --> 0.20 in an unknown version\
== Trivia==\
*Has the most fighter count in a single carrier in the game at '''12''', tied with [[Bonehawk]]s.\
*Has an even older model older than it's current model, which the [[Spirit]] also uses.\

== Description ==\
This ship is a very good choice for beginners. The exterior of the '''Cobra''' features two jets, four fins, a heavy armor plating, and rapid-fire phasers.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior contains ten seats for transporting passengers and a pilot control panel.\
== Advantages ==\
* Excellent overall firepower and [[Turrets|Turret]] placement.\
* Quite fast for its size and class.\
* One of the best choices as a starting ship.\
* Extremely deadly to shield based ships; its [[Spinals|Spinal]] does massive damage and has a short reload speed.\
*Able to get to blind spots quickly.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low Hull.\
* Due to most of the health belonging in shields, the '''Cobra''' is more vulnerable to enemy ships with mostly or all laser weapons, like the [[Bastion]].\
* Does significantly less damage to hull than shields, though still considerable.\
* Rather large for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]], having the tendency to get hit by bigger turrets often.\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship is excellent to deploy as a counterattack in a siege.\
* Can easily maneuver to the underside of a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] or any class above it to avoid incoming fire.\
\
* Try to use the ship's speed to outmaneuver and dodge incoming fire because of its low health pool.\
== Trivia ==\
* This ship was originally based off a transport ship built by hamma1.\
* Appears similar to the Overlord transport ship from Kill-zone.\
* The name \"Cobra\" might have come from the creator's username.\
* When a cobra attempts to dock at [[Aqueous II]] it's wing will get stuck on the platform and will not dock.\
* One of the last ships in the game that still have a model that was created when the game was in alpha.\

"Bounty","''Not to be confused with [[Score]].''\
== Overview ==\
'''''Bounty''''' is a mechanic similar to [[Score]] that is purely based on the amount and types of ships you destroy. '''Bounty''' is earned by destroying other player's ships. (Not including the [[Wasp]] or [[Wyrm]]). The amount of '''Bounty''' awarded per ship destroyed appears to be a function of the cost of the destroyed ship. '''Bounty''' is lost if your own ship is destroyed, and many players find it difficult to get '''Bounty''' and keep it. If a starbase (or a NPC ship) destroys your ship, you will keep your bounty. Not having '''Bounty''' doesn't make you a bad or inexperienced player, as many very strong and experienced players simply don't actively hunt for it. If you kill players that have '''Bounty''', you won't be given '''Bounty''' but instead will take their '''Bounty''' as credits. The record for the highest bounty ever is Speci1374 (Previously known as Axxuri) with more than 13 Million. Speci1374 no longer has that because rcouret reset everyone's bounty in late August 2020. As of the current version, the rate of bounty to material values of ship is 1:5. 1 bounty for every 5 material cost credit.\
== Gaining Bounty ==\
To gain '''Bounty''', you must destroy a [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] or a [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] owned by a player with no '''Bounty'''. Many players do this through a method called [[Pirating]].\
==Bounty Hunting==\
[[Bounty]] hunters are players who hunt other players for their bounty (hence the name). Bounty hunters are sometimes confused with [[Pirating|Pirates]] due to the fact that they may kill anybody else with a good enough bounty. Another reason why bounty hunters are also seen as pirates is their ship choice. Many bounty hunters will use small fast ships that holds a variety of guns to take down the ships quickly without having the reinforcements arrive before the ship is destroyed. Pirate ship choices are very similar to bounty hunter ship choices. [[Ships]] like these include the [[Gideon]], [[Cobra]], and the [[Sixfold]]. Bounty hunters typically have large amounts of bounty themselves and many are skilled pilots.\

The '''Derelict Station''' is a [[starbase]] that was added during the [[Galaxy Star Wars Event]] update. You could obtain the [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/566778868/Galactic-Sun-Hat Galactic Sun Hat] and the Going Nuclear badge (now called Complete Quest 2) by delivering 20 [[Ores|Uranium Ore]] to the station. Before public release of the [[Galaxy Star Wars Event]], there used to be a button in the [[starbase]] menu labeled '''DO NOT PRESS.''' If you selected that option, the station would blow up after a short amount of time. The '''Derelict Station''' has an explosive radius of 100. It can be upgraded once to Level 2.\
\
== Interior ==\
The '''Derelict Station''' has only 4 terminals, the same amount as a level 1 [[Starbase]]. The interior is mostly small with 2 hallways going to different rooms in the station, each connected to terminals. There is a quarters that players may spawn in with some knocked over chairs and tables. Near some of the terminals are green and purple teleporters that lead to the other side of the [[Starbase]].\
\
== Version History ==\
* '''Derelict Station''' received a remodel in version .66b. It shared many of the same features, but was made more detailed than the original.\
* Became the home to one of many optional player quests added in version .66b\
* Version .66b, 10/25/19: can now be upgraded to Level Two, gains custom turrets and more health. (11000 [[Shields|Shield]] and 11000 [[Hull]])\
\
== Trivia ==\
* In 2018, YouTubers found out that you could still do the event for the hats and mass-made videos on how to do it, leading to hundreds of players joining Galaxy.\
** Unfortunately though, within two weeks of Conor3D uploading his video on these quests, the game was patched so players could no longer obtain the gear from the 2016 [[Galaxy Star Wars Event]].\
* There is a part of the top of the '''Derelict Station''' that appears to have a hole. Some players believe it's the result of an alien attack.\
* Quest #2 - Going Nuclear has made a return for the [[Christmas Event 2018]], however, the quest can only be activated when the '''Derelict Station''' [[Starbase]] is in the server.\
* If you complete it now, you will get 400 [[Credits|Credits.]]\
* Has its own custom turrets.\

== Description ==\
The '''Inquisitor''' is a Cruiser with 2 [[Turrets|Light Turrets]] and strong [[Spinals]] for its class. The 2 [[Turrets]] are positioned on the top of the ship. The ship strikes a balance between health, maneuverability and weapons.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of this ship is very small and plain, contrary to its decorated exterior. There is a teleporter pad at the rear of the ship that leads to a small, windowless room. The room only contains a seat and a small note pinned on the wall that shows lordmoneymonkey's avatar.\
== Advantages ==\
* Balanced shield and hull damage.\
* Good amount of cargo hold.\
* Moderate speed.\
* Strong [[Spinals]] for its class.\
* Very cheap.\
* High health for a Cruiser.\

* Low [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
* Can be outmaneuvered by most other [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]].\
* Weak underside.\
== Strategy ==\
* Make use of [[Spinals]] for full effectiveness.\
== Version History ==\
* Spinal barrel count increased from 1/1 to 2/2 in version .66b.\
*Randomly taken offsale twice in (unknown version please add) with no explanation.\
== Trivia ==\
* This ship's description is a reference to the 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' series.\
* The avatar depicted in the note inside the interior is that of one of the game's former Shipmasters,[[Retired Galaxy Staff|lordmoneymonkey]].\
*When re-added to the Build Menu after its spontaneous removal, it was implied that it would be removed again for an unknown reason.\

== Description ==\
The '''Festive Wyrm''' is a ship that was handed out by Galaxy Admins during New Year's Eve and New Year's Day of the [[Christmas Event 2018]]. The ship has some Christmas decorations on it, including a Santa hat, two wreaths, and some Christmas lights strung on it. The ship was also recolored and had its stats changed.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Festive Wyrm''' has the same tiny interior as the [[Wyrm]], with the only difference being the change in color.\
== Advantages ==\
* High [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] points for its size.\
* Good Speed to Cargo Hold ratio. \
* Very good at vulturing.\
* One of the best Freighters in the game when it comes to overall stats.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Once lost, you cannot get it back.\
* [[Pirates]] are more likely to target you.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use your speed to get to loot and run away before [[Pirating|Pirates]] can even get to you.\
* Use your high speed and tiny size to dodge enemy fire.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .65b.\
*Fixed part-shift .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* If you were to kill one and the player had 0 [[Bounty]], you would gain 27,137 [[Bounty]].\
* If you were to sell this [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] you would receive 81,410 credits for it.\
* Unlike the [[Festive Wasp]] and [[Coal Wasp]] giveaway during the [[Christmas Event 2017]], players could re-obtain the '''Festive Wyrm''' after selling it between the two days it was being given away.\
* Despite the rumors spread about the Festive Wyrm not appearing on the map, the '''Festive Wyrm''', in fact, does appear on the map. This rumor was most likely started by a pirate attempting to lure the ship into a false sense of security and kill it.\
* Despite the fact that there is a [[Coal Wasp]], there is no Coal Wyrm.\
* Used as a \"Viper\" during sieges to Speed Tank bases, after the base dies, you can be the first one to loot the base.\

"Warp_Drive","The '''Warp Drive''' is a feature of nearly every ship in the game (the main exception being all [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter-class]] ships) that allows them to travel in one direction at a very fast speed. The '''Warp Drive''' is activated by pressing the button 'V' on your keyboard or by clicking on the warp button.  The '''Warp Drive''' will begin charging once the warp button is pressed or the 'V' key is pressed on your keyboard. A UI will then appear telling you how much it has charged.  You must first know how far you wish to travel and then press 'V' again once the charge level reaches that distance. Your ship will then accelerate at a very fast rate in the direction you were pointing for the distance that you chose. During this state of warping, ships cannot fire turrets or spinals, change direction, or stop short of the set warp distance. After being used, the '''Warp Drive''' will be deactivated for a cooldown period that varies with how far you traveled.  There is an indicator just above the movement panel to tell you the status of your warp drive.\

\
==How it theoretically works==\
A warp drive engine uses matter in the form of deuterium and antimatter to mutually annihilate them together in a fusion reaction which is mediated by dilithium crystals. This chemical reaction produces enormous amounts of energy to warp space-time itself using warp field generators to push the ship beyond unimaginable speeds. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_drive\
==Trivia==\
*One of the older iterations of the '''Warp Drive '''used to function as a sort of “bubble warp”. A player would charge up their warp drive for only a few moments, and charge through space at a speed of 7000 studs per second; while in warp, the user would not take any damage from turrets or spinals.\
*In Alpha, different ships had varying warp acceleration speeds and maximum warp speeds. This often lead to larger ships being much more vulnerable in early-warp states.\
*During certain phases of Alpha, ships had the ability to fire turrets during warp, leading to strategies such as \"warp sieges.\" Players often used smaller, heavily armed ships such as the [[Grievion]] to maximize the effectiveness of this strategy.\
*In the past, warp cooldowns could reach absurdly high amounts on low-end devices due to movement glitches. This was mostly fixed in a later update when [[Rcouret]] set a maximum cooldown limit.\
*[[:Category:Miner|Miner-class]] ships used to be largely without warp drives. The original exception to this was the Harvester, making it a valuable tool in Alpha versions of Galaxy. All Miner-class ships later gained warp drives.\

*Attack a starbase then warp away.\
== Version History ==\
* Was remodeled in version .60d.\
* Was remodeled again in version .68d1.\
* [[Spinals|Small Torpedo]] removed in version .69a2\
* [[Spinals|Small Torpedo]] re-added in version .69a2\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Starblade's''' original model looks similar to and is named similarly to the Guardians Of The Galaxy ship \"Star Blaster\".\
* The '''Starblade''' was once used by [[Pirates]] near the [[Freedom Base]], along with the [[Avenger]] and the [[Osprey]], but was removed because of its aimbot. (Currently, only the [[Avenger]] spawns as a pirate ship)\
* One of the most common starter ships.\
* Was remodeled in The Halloween 2017 event as the \"[[Spiderblade]]\".\
* Some players refer to this as a \"kekblade\".\
* This ship was a Cruiser in Pre-Alpha.\
* This ship used to like a Nova Core in Guardians Of The Galaxy.\

==Description==\
The '''Retro Gideon''' uses the original model of the Gideon, with its 4 prominent blade-like protrusions on the front and back and the central bracing down the front end of the ship. It is more powerful and more well-armored than the current [[Gideon]], and was a limited ship that was part of the [[Retro Ship Event 2019|2019 Retro Ships event]].\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Retro Gideon''' is practically the same as the current [[Gideon]]. You enter from a side door that leads to the pilot seat. Behind the pilot seat, there is another room that has a couch behind what seems to be a television screen.\
==Advantages==\
* Very high Health for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]], surpassing even multiple [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]].\
* Good maneuverability.\
*Very high turret-based firepower.\
*All turrets are on top, which makes it quite easy to manage the line of sight.\

* Vulnerable underside.\
* Weak against pest control ships.\
==Strategy==\
* Be careful while using it, as it is a limited event ship.\
* Try to stay below your target since all of its weapons are on top.\
*Use its agility to exploit larger ships' blindspots.\
*All the turrets are on top, so if the line of sight is blocked, you can rotate the ship to make sure they all hit.\
==Version History==\
* Received a buff in .66b shortly after the event ended.\
*Gained 3 Retro Small Lasers and 2 Retro Light Flak Cannons in [[Update Log|version .73a3.]]\

==Disadvantages==\
*Requires decent spinal aim.\

*It has a fully modeled mini version of a capital cannon on the bottom. However, as of now it is just for vanity purposes.\
*When spawned, the song \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6120QOlsfU Darude - Sandstorm]\" plays. '''For unknown reasons it does not play the song anymore'''\
*Just like the previous April Fool's ship, the [[Prototype X-3]], the event was very similar, as it required players to travel far off the map and asked a joke price of 6,000,000 credits, but in addition of an alien device and a weapon's part, in the end costing only 25,000 credits.\
*When the ship is in warp mode, the soundtrack becomes distorted. This may be an attempt to replicate the Doppler effect in-game.\
*Name is based on the tyrant, a test super-capital.\
*It is the second ship to have \"baby\" in the name. The other being [[Baby Leviathan]]\
*It is modeled after the Tyrant from Star conflict.\

==Description   ==\
The '''Icy''' is a Limited Event cruiser for the [[Christmas Event 2017|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Christmas Event 2017</span>]] which is modeled after the [[Invictus]]. The '''Icy''' has a very similar interior and exterior to the [[Invictus]]; however, the '''Icy''' has an extra wing and 3 [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]] instead of 4 [[Turrets|Small Lasers]]. There are also many crystals on the '''Icy''', similar to the [[Blizzard]].\
== Appearance ==\
The Interior of the '''Icy''' contains long hallway, however the floor as a surface is slippery, hence the name '''Icy'''. There are crystals at the entrance and a row of chairs leading to the cockpit with what appears to be two screens.\
==Advantages   ==\
*Good mobility.\
*Extremely high health for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser.]]\
*Good firepower.\
*Great against shields.\
==Disadvantages  ==\
*Can't do much damage to hulled ships.\
*Double the price of the [[Invictus]], which has similar statistics.\
*Unable to pierce hull.\
*Low shield integrity.\
*Slow [[Spinals|Spinal]] reload time.\
*Less total health than the [[Invictus]].\
*No longer being sold.\
==Strategy ==\
* Excellent choice if you want to hunt down [[Cobra]]s since it has a laser arsenal which can destroy the [[Cobra]] in seconds.\
* Use as support for ships that lack Laser/Phaser firepower.\
* When engaged, always make sure you are exploiting the enemy's blind spot with your high speed.\
* Fight ships with anti-laser arsenals, as your high [[Hull]] will protect you from their lasers.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .60.\
* Received a rebalance in .60d that boosted [[Shields]] by 400 and decreased [[Hull]] by 100.\
* Received an extra [[Turrets|Medium Laser Turret]] in .64f.\

*This ship is a reskin from the [[Christmas Event 2017|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Christmas Event 2017</span>]].\

==Description==\
Little is known about this ship. 0ctav1on is the only confirmed owner of this ship.\
==Appearance==\
Like its nickname suggests, it is an abomination of a ship. It is made up of random parts from a lot of ships including [[Astraeus]] and [[M Class]]. The teleporters and interiors of the ships that make up of the Abomination are removed. 2 fighters can be seen at the top. It is unknown of they're able to be flown in extension of the Bubble Shields. It is unknown where the pilot seat is located.\
==Advantages==\
*Armed with Bubble Shield fighters, which are very large and tanky.\
*The Abomination's and its fighters' large size are useful for completely protecting a base from fighters and sieges alike.\
*Incredibly fast and agile.\
*Basically impossible to die with it, even when dived by multiple Prototypes. With its 75% damage resistance, BubbleShield fighters and 70k total health, it would take an entire clan worth of Prototypes to even stand a chance at killing it.\
==Disadvantages==\
*This is a very rare ship and is likely to be hunted.\
*Extremely large, larger than most Super Capitals. It is very hard to miss this ship with turrets and spinals.\
*Once you lose it, you can never get it back.\
*No method of damaging others.\
==Strategy==\
*Use your Bubble Shield fighters to completely surround and protect a base from siege. They are large and numerous enough to completely protect [[Frion I|Frion]].\
==Trivia==\
*The only confirmed owner of this ship is 0ctav1on (formerly known as teen, one of the developer team members)\
*Attempting to use :info command on this ship will result in scrambled data.\
*Although a total of 15 turrets can be seen on the ship, none of them can be fired.\
*This ship has the same ambience as [[Prototype X-2]] and [[Abaddon]]. Both of them play at random intervals.\
*Even though this ship is a Titan, it is almost nothing more than a harmless ship.\

== Description ==\
The '''Osprey''' is rather large and powerful for a Frigate, but still manages decent top speed and maneuverability. It has two main thrusters connected to the back wings. The front also has two large phaser arrays, making the [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] easy to spot.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Osprey''' is small, containing a bed, a chair with a computer, and a simple pilot's seat with faction colored padding. In front of the seat is a control panel with three main displays. The interior also has a decal left by the creator.\
\
{{Image Infobox|title1 = Osprey's Interior|image = RobloxScreenShot20190225 122549927.png}}\
== Advantages ==\
* Great DPS for a Frigate.\
\
* Good mobility.\
* Decent cargo hold for a Frigate.\
* Exceptional Turret firepower with its 8 tiny and small turrets.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Average health despite great firepower, somewhat of a glass cannon.\
*Relatively large size for a Frigate, making it easier to hit.\
* Without its [[Spinals]], it has extremely low shield damage.\
*The most expensive [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] on the build menu.\
== Strategy ==\
* Can be used as defence against [[Aliens|Swarmers]], [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]], and [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* Make sure to use your agility to your advantage and constantly move around to throw players off.\
*Assemble a swarm for amazing power against larger ships.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a remodel in an unknown version.\
*4 [[Turrets|Tiny Cannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Tiny Lasers]] added in version .72c29\

==Description==\
The '''Vigilance''' is a large [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] that focuses on broadside weaponry.\
==Interior==\
The interior is very basic, having a seat and various plain-looking neon control panels. It is rather small and is barely tall enough for the player to stand in.\
==Advantages==\
* Cheap for a battlecruiser.\
* High health for its class.\
* The broadside-oriented loadout makes it effective in combat, especially against larger ships.\
* Its two [[Turrets|Medium Railguns]] can target enemies from long distances.\
* The broadside spinals can deal high amounts of damage if used correctly.\
* High shield DPS for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*Pathetic Maneuverability and Acceleration, leading to the backside being highly vulnerable.\
*Its broadside profile makes it an easy target for [[Spinals]].\
*Slow for its class.\
*Rather low Hull damage.\
*Currently has no pilot's seat.\
*A little expensive for a starter.\
==Strategy==\
* Use it as a support ship in [[Sieging|Siege]] battles.\
* Do not go head to head with a smaller more maneuverable ship like a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]], as your slow maneuverability will leave you at a disadvantage.\
* Just like both the Osiris and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Behemoth]], attack broadside for all your weapons to hit your enemy.\
==Version History==\
* Shield was buffed from 0 to 1250 in version .65b after it was added.\
* Broadside spinals added in version .66b\
* Turn Speed increased from 0.2 to 0.3, and Acceleration increased from 10 to 12.5 in version .75a5.\
*Spinal interval decreased from 0.1 -> 0 (all spinals shoot simultaneously) .75a12\
==Trivia==\
* Looked like a mini Armageddon before the Armageddon was remodeled.\
* Its [[Turrets]] are placed for a broadside position to work best when firing at a target.\
*the ship is some times thought to look like a Train.\
*This ship somewhat resembles the [[Galleon]]\

== Description ==\
The '''Abyss''' is a medium dogfighter [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] that can deal high [[Hull]] damage. It has a main body with two wings carrying two Large cannon shaped guns, each of which shoot 5 projectiles in a row.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Abyss '''effectively has no interior. There is a small [[Factions|Faction]]-colored pad that acts as a pilot's seat and a semi-transparent black cover that conceals all but the top of the player's head.\
== Advantages ==\
* Extremely high Acceleration.\
* Shreds [[Hull]].\
* High mobility.\
* Great for distracting a [[Starbase]].\
* Great for finishing off ships that have been heavily damaged in fleet combat.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Minimal [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
* No [[Turrets]].\
* [[Spinals]] being tiny have a limited range.\
* Lower than average health for Frigates. \
==Strategy<nowiki/>==\
* When fighting larger ships, never stop moving until you can get in their blind spot and fire your [[Spinals]].\
* Watch out for ships with Light [[Turrets]] like the [[Ampharos]] and the [[Mjolnheimr]].\
* Get a small group of these, 3 or 4, and attack [[Starbase]]s when they get to low health. Don't attempt this on Starbases that still have [[Shields|Shield]] health, as the '''Abyss '''can't break Shield very well.\
*Team up with either [[Avenger]]s or [[Spider]]s to dish out damage against Cruisers and Battlecruisers. They shred the shields, you shred the hull. \
== Version History ==\
* Received a remodel in version ???\
* Remodel by Pleeber .75a27\
* Buffed Health increased (200/200) -> (250/250) Tiny cannon count increased (7 -> 11) Speed decreased (300 -> 240) .75a27\
== Trivia==\
* Before the remodel, it looked mostly green and wouldn't change color based on team colors.\
*Before the remodel it was most likely the oldest model still in the game.\
*The '''Abyss''' is great at diving crippled [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], as the 10 [[Spinals|Tiny Cannons]] do lots of [[Hull]] damage while the small size and high mobility of the ship makes it possible to dodge incoming enemy fire.\

== Description ==\
It is armed with two [[Turrets|Light Lasers]] and four [[Spinals|Small Cannons]]. With this, the '''Argosy''' is able to deal a good amount of hull damage.\
== Appearance ==\
The Interior of the '''Argosy''' is that of a hallway leading from the back of the ship to the front of the ship that has the pilot seat and a windshield to look out of. In the hallway is somewhere to sit and a set of bunk beds.\
== Advantages ==\
* Very high hull health for its class.\
* Good amount of hull damage output.\
* Cheap.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Almost non-existent shields.\
* [[Turrets]] are highly obstructed, and have very small firing arcs\
* Slow speed for a destroyer, even below average for frigates\
* Does considerably less shield damage compared to hull.\
* Weak against anything above a destroyer.\
== Strategy ==\
* Works very well when paired with a ship with good shield damage output, such as the [[Cobra]].\
* Great for attacking ships within base range, as losing it isn't much of a problem due to the very low cost.\
* The low cost of this ship, coupled with versatile armament, make it a dream come true for a swarm ship.\
* The versatile armament of this ship coupled with its low price makes this ship an ideal [[Pirating|Pirate]] vessel.\
* Shield damage is somewhat lacking even with the [[Turrets|Light Lasers]]. It is extremely slow for a Destroyer, even some Battleships will move faster. It has almost non-existent shields, but the highest amount of hull in its class, making it very effective against ships that primarily deal shield damage.\
* Diving bases wouldn't be the smartest idea, as bases could hit turrets easier with your slow speed.\
* If aligned correctly, the lasers can break through shields, then the cannons can finish the hull.\
== Trivia ==\
*Has similar features to the old [[Archeon]] model.\

==Description==\
A sphere with multiple patches of Obama's face on it. The exterior is non-collidable. The quest giver for the '''obamasphere''' was found in the top half of Terminal A of the Mega Base, where it asked players for 5000 credits to complete a vague quest.\
==Interior==\
The '''obamasphere''' has a small plank with a seat on the inside. This is very similar to other spherical ships such as the [[Snowball]].\
==Advantages==\
* Extreme speed and maneuverability\
* Extremely small hitbox\
== Disadvantages ==\
* If you lose this, you can't get it back.\
*Has very low HP\
==Version History==\
* Re-classed from Frigate to Miner in version .72f\
* Ore Hold reduced from 6500 to 1 in order to reduce explosion radius in version .72f\
*Hitbox enlarged thus making this ship unable to enter starbases.\
*Re-classed from Miner to Frigate in an unknown version\
==Trivia==\
* The first person to lose an '''obamasphere''' was BottomOfTheSwamp.\
* The '''o''' in '''obamasphere''' is lowercase, meaning it sorts to the bottom of your Spawn Ship list.\
* The '''obamasphere''' quest giver only ever said the word \"obamasphere,\" except upon completing the quest, when it says \"gamer.\" The player must click through dialogue options until they receive the quest, then return with 5000 credits to complete it.\
* During the single day when the quest was enabled, pirate obamaspheres spawned naturally. Despite being Frigates, these ships posed no threat due to their lack of weaponry, similar to an [[X-0]], though it was unable to call.\
*Was only a mere 5000 credits, which allowed both new players and old players to get this ship. \
\
\
==July 7th Incident==\
On July 7th, 2021, the '''obamasphere''' was changed to a miner and given 6500 ore hold by SuperChip15. This resulted in the '''obamasphere''' being worth 300k and having an extreme nuke, approximately the nuke of the [[Galaxy]]. At 1:09 PM Eastern time, two obamaspheres were nuked in a private server, not knowing the explosion radius and damage. An [[E Class]], a [[Weapon of Mass Destruction]], and an [[Icebreaker]] were destroyed by the explosion.\
[[File:Obamasphere incident.png|none|left|frame|July 7th Incident]]\
The nuke of the '''obamasphere''' has been nerfed due to this incident until a new patch rolls out (Which it has now as of 3/15/2022)\

==Description==\
The Retro Hercules is a limited version of the [[Hercules]], featuring its original model.\
==Interior==\
* The Retro Hercules has an interior where you are greeted by a cargo deck with a few crates and a teleporter in the rear, where you are then teleported to an upper deck with the pilot's seat/computer and passenger seats\
==Advantages==\
* Extremely high turn speed for it's size, being faster than most other ships overall.\
* 9,000 overall health, combined with the high speed makes it hard to kill compared to most freighters.\
* Is surprisingly easy to dock, allowing for quick trading runs and escape from most [[pirates]].\
* Can act as a passenger ship if ever necessary due large amounts of seats.\
* Second largest cargo ship of ''all'' player ships in-game.\
* Has 2 (railgun?) turrets, which may be used to defend itself if need be.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Very, very expensive.\
* Limited, so you cannot get it back once lost.\
* Can be seen as a trophy kill to pirates due to its expensive cost and being a Limited kill.\
* ''Awful'' cargo hold size relative to the cost by today's standards.\
==Strategy==\
* Only use when not in war, if used at all.\
* Make sure to see that area you are heading to is all clear.\
* If you do decide to use it during war, use its high speed to quickly dock at the [[Mega Base]] before any [[pirates]] can get to you.\
* Although the Retro Hercules has turrets, it is recommended to use them sparingly, as their damage output is unlikely to deal significant damage.\
==Version History==\
* Added in .66b, along with the [[Retro Ship Event 2019]].\
* Received a buff along with all other retro event ships in version .66b shortly after the event ended.\
* Received a buff cargo 6500 to 8500 and received 2 \"Anti-Vulture\" turrets.\
==Trivia==\
* 3 [[Wasp]]s (if not more) are able to fit inside the '''Retro Hercules'''.\
* This ship is the original model of the [[Hercules]] freighter.\
* This ship has its own unique turrets likely-humorously named \"Anti-Vulture\" turrets using the model of early medium lasers.\

* Limited classification means it will be targeted very often.\
* Has a poor health pool.\
* DPS is entirely hull focused, minus the phaser spinals.\
* Extremely expensive.\
* Underwhelming overall damage output compared to other [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] Battleships.\
==Strategy==\
* Do not use this ship in a battle unless you are sure your ship won't be at risk of being destroyed.\
* Use this ship as a distraction, or as a support ship in PvP engagements.\
* Don't try to tank in this ship, it isn't capable of taking a beating unlike ships like the [[Sovereign]] or [[Cutlass]].\
* Keep moving fast in this ship during a battle, it's one of the key things that helps this ship survive.\
==Version History==\
* In .75a3, Shadowmane’s top speed was increased to 145 after being 135. It’s acceleration was increased from 45 and was changed to 55. Lastly, It’s turn speed was increased from .4 and was changed to .5.\
*Explosion size 250 ----> 510 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
* littlemineblox123 was the first person to lose this ship, to an Alien [[Alien Scout|Scout]].\
*Shadowmane is a certain dinosaur in ARK: Survival Evolved.\

==Description==\
The '''Heartbreaker''' largely has a color scheme of pink and red. It has a fairly retro building style, using mostly vanilla studio bricks and as few meshes as a possible. It was sold by Confinium (NPC) on the 3rd floor of the [[Galaxy VIP Lounge|VIP lounge]].\
\
==Interior==\
The ship's interior consists of a chair next to a teleporter underneath a glass dome. Behind the chair is a small container labeled \"Heartifact Storage\".\
\
==Advantages==\
*Very high health for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
*Good mobility.\
*Very powerful [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]].\
*High DPS.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
*Requires [[Spinals|Spinal]] aiming in order to deal efficient [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
*Very expensive for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
*If destroyed, you cannot get it back (unless refunded).\
*A target for pirates as it is an event ship.\
*Very small cargo hold compared to other Battlecruisers.\
\
==Strategy==\
*Spinal aim is crucial in dealing effective shield damage.\
*Use with caution, as it is a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ship and will be focused in a battle.\
\
==Version History==\
*Taken offsale on an unknown date.\
*Top Speed increased from 120 to 135, 1 [[Spinal Weaponry|Medium Phaser]] added and put back on-sale (for Valentine's Day only) in version .71b2.\
\
==Trivia==\
*The first Valentine's Day ship to be added to Galaxy.\
*The first Heartbreaker to be destroyed was thecoolestguyeverrrr's Heartbreaker. It was destroyed by Bomb_Pops's [[3D Printed Warlock]].\
*Has custom [[Turrets]] and Turret sounds.\
*Better [[Spinals]] than some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*The creator of this ship, Poke, originally made the '''Heartbreaker''' grey, but then the old Admin Director, Confinium, made it pink, leading to some drama that has since been dealt with.\

* Stay in your enemies' blind spots, or use your speed to dodge incoming fire.\
* It has high shield damage, making it possible to hull an unprotected [[Alien Punisher]].\
== Version History ==\
* Received a nerf in .62a1 that lowered the [[Spinals|Spinal]] barrel count from 4 to 2 and lowered the speed from 300 to 285.\

== Description==\
The '''MLMLRS''' is a Battlecruiser that looks exactly like the [[MLRS]], just ''<u>way</u>'' bigger. It is [[Spinals|Torpedo]]-focused, like its regular counterpart.\
==Appearance==\
This ship doesn't have much of an interior, featuring just a small cockpit in the middle of the ship with a seat the player hops into and 3 screens in front of the seat.\
==Advantages==\
*Great amount of health for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
*Decent spinals.\
* Works well for PvP combat if you can predict where your target is going to move and fire accordingly.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Vulnerable bottom.\
*Very large size for its class.\
*Low maneuverability.\
*Cannot be rebuilt.\
==Strategy==\
*Stay in the back of the fleet and kill any small [[Ships]] that come your way, while attacking larger targets with your [[Spinals]].\
* Use your [[Spinals|Torpedoes]] to attack larger, slower moving ships such as [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], as smaller [[ships]] can evade your [[Spinals|Torpedoes]].\
*Go near targets for more accurate Torpedo hits.\
*Try to siege hulled bases with this ship from 9k away with the torpedo's.\
== Version History==\
*Added for the [[April Fool's Event 2022]] on March 31st.\
* Nerfed after the [[April Fool's Event 2022]] ended, losing its massive spinal count and downgrading its 4 Large Torpedoes to 4 Tiny Torpedoes.\
* Renamed from MRLS Launcher Launcher to MLMLRS in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
*Before its nerf, it was the most powerful ship players could obtain for free due to the insane [[Spinals|Spinal]] count and Health difference from the other two free ships, the [[Wasp]] and the [[Wyrm]].\
* Before its nerf, it had the highest [[Spinals|Spinal]] count in the game at a whopping 255 (251 small torpedoes shaped like MRLS Launchers, and 4 regular Large torpedoes)\
**At one point before their complete removal, the 251 Torpedoes were changed to no longer reload and could only be fired once after the ship was spawned.\

==Behavior==\
It follows the same pattern as most [[AI]] ships and will linger at its home base [[Ø₴łⱤł₴ ⱠɆ₲łØ₦]].\
\
It spawns every 60 minutes in a pair and only does so on Public servers. Additionally it only spawns when the [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]], [[Ø₴łⱤł₴ ⱠɆ₲łØ₦]] is present.\

The Pl̸͌͝å̷̛g̸͑̃ȗ̵͠e̵͌̔d̴̑͘ ̴̌̀O̵͛͘s̶̏̕i̷̓͒r̷̓͋ì̵͝s̵̓̊ is an extremely powerful and dangerous [[:Category:Boss|Boss]] which stays at it home base [[Ø₴łⱤł₴ ⱠɆ₲łØ₦]]. Since it only spawns on public servers, call for support from other players to take it down.\
\
It is recommended to use the same strategy for other boss ships, which is using fast ships to lure it so that other ships can gun it down. Another strategy similar to this is to let Aliens capture a planet, then use the planet to lure it out of its [[Ø₴łⱤł₴ ⱠɆ₲łØ₦|Starbase]].\

==Description==\
The '''Consul''' Class Battleship was developed to be able to maintain a fast attack, and then be able to quickly escape in battle. The lighter more compact body of the ship was created to allow for better speed and weapon placement to ensure it could maintain a presence in the midst of a fight. Named after a government position that many held in high esteem, the Consul is a tasteful example of a fine machinery and it's prized by the few who hold it. Built by the shipyards of Terran Remnant.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Consul '''has little to no interior with one teleporter on the back of the ship to get out. It is pretty much a long rectangle with a pyramid. It's darkish blue with multiple turrets on top and turrets on the side and bottom. It is flanked by two wings with nothing on them.\
\
==Advantages==\
* No blind spots, besides a small one in the back.\
* Good shield and [[Hull]] damage from its 9 [[Turrets]].\
* Great speed and maneuverability for a battleship.\
* Great for pirating.\
* Good as a first Battleship.\
==Disadvantages==\
* No spinal capabilities.\
* Hard to aim all [[Turrets]] at the same time.\
*Rather low DPS for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
==Strategy==\
* This ship is an excellent choice against other battleships.\
* Get in your opponent's blind spots.\
* Try to stay in ranges or at angles that maximize the turret lines of sight.\
* Turn your ship sideways when fighting ships above/below you so your Triple Heavy Lasers and Heavy LR Laser are both in field of view.\
==Version History==\
* Received a remodel in version .66b.\
* [[Shields]] reduced to 3000 and [[Hull]] reduced to 2350 in version .69a1.\
*Explosion size 75 ----> 300 .75a12\
*Was Removed from build menu due to a unfixable bug in an unknown version.\
*Was returned to the build menu later.\

==Description==\
The '''Dragonfly''' was the first [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] added into the game and was originally a ship that was spawnable by players. It is currently the game's fastest [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]], with the second smallest health pool, and one of the three [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to have a [[Spinals|Small Cannon]] as a weapon, the others including the [[Nixesion]] and [[Blitz]]. This fighter used to only spawn on [[Frion I|Lucifer Station]], before it and the [[Unarmed Envoy]] were replaced by the [[Xenophile]] and [[Striker]]. \
\
It now only spawns in level 2+ starbases, with 2 dragonflies sharing a rather small fighter bay with 2 [[Starbase Fury|Starbase Furies]].\
== Appearance ==\
Like all fighter class ships, the '''Dragonfly''' has little in the way of an interior.\
==Advantages==\
* Very quick.\
* Can weaken [[Hull]] so teammates can finish them off.\
* Is the fastest fighter in the game.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Low damage.\
* Hard to aim at moving ships.\
* Smaller spinal count than the Starbase Fury.\
==Strategy==\
* As the fastest non-limited ship in the game, this ship is fantastic for distracting base fire. Even open fire from many ships will not be able to hit this from time to time.\
* Work with other [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to harass large ships.\
*This ship is weak against almost everything alone, so it is better as a distraction.\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled in .61e4?\
* Started spawning on [[Frion I|Frion I's]] Lucifer Station in an unknown version.\
*Stopped spawning on the Lucifer Station in version .73b along with the Unarmed Envoy, and were replaced by the Striker and Xenophile.\
*Started spawning in level 2+ faction-owned Starbases.[[File:Dragonfly-0.png|thumb|257x257px|Old Dragonfly Model]]\
== Trivia ==\
* Used to be a possible fighter spawn for a [[Starbase]] along with the [[Fury]] and the [[Xenophile]], and it got added with the Fury.\
* Used to spawn into the [[Hevnetier]] before the fighter randomization feature was removed from the [[Hevnetier]]. After the carrier's remodel, it lost the ability to spawn the fighter, leaving the [[Blizzard]] as the only ship that could spawn it.\
* Replaced by the [[IceFyre]] in the Blizzard buff.\
* Used to only found on Frion's orbital space station.\

== Description ==\
The '''Raven''' is a fast and maneuverable Frigate that can distract and out-maneuver larger ships, getting into their blind spots. Its major weakness is its low durability, preventing it from fighting alone for extended periods of time.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Raven''' has a detailed pilot's seat with cushions the color of the player's faction. In front of the seat is a control wheel and a radar/display screen. The right side of the cockpit also has a few buttons and a decal left by the creator.\
== Advantages ==\
* Decent [[Spinals|Spinal]] DPS.\
* A solid ship for beginners.\
* Fantastic for scouting due to its small size, disposable cost and basic functionality.\
* Sometimes under-estimated by new players using larger ships, possibly ending with a quick comeuppance for the overconfident.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low amount of health.\
*Hard to aim [[Spinals]], unless you're fighting slow or large targets.\
*Low damage output.\
*Despite the '''Raven'''<nowiki/>'s description saying it's a fast agile ship, it's actually among the slowest Frigates in both top speed and turn speed.\
==Strategy==\
*Use it to distract [[Starbase]] [[Turrets]] and counter enemy [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Fly into large ships' blind spots and slowly deal damage.\
*Avoid anything that has a Turret pointed at you, especially if the turret is high-accuracy (Flak Cannons, Point Defense Lasers, etc.)\
*Staying at Top Speed is critical to limiting damage.\
==Version History==\
*[[Turrets|Light Turret]] removed in some part of version .61 or .62.\
*Received a remodel decreasing its size and altering its appearance in version .61g. A minor buff soon followed, adding its [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannon]].\
== Trivia==\
*The '''Raven''' is currently the smallest and cheapest purchasable combat ship in the game.\
*One of the most common starter ships.\
* The Pilots feet pop out the bottom of the '''Raven'''.\
* Some players will spam this ship. One player spent over 100k credits doing so.[[File:SRaven.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Old Raven Model]]\

* Since it is among the fastest ships in the game, it can be used as a shuttle.\
* Great for wearing down larger ships if you can stay in their blind spot.\
* Very effective in swarms, as the speed and shape of the ship make it hard to destroy.\
* If used in a swarm it is possible to siege star bases using its speed and maneuverability.\
*One of the ships utilized in the notorious infern spinal TP, despawn if you see this happening.\
== Version History ==\
* Its description received a minor rewrite between versions .46 and .48.\
* Max speed increased to 230 from 210 in .65b\
* 4 [[Spinals|Small Phasers]] changed to 2 Medium Phasers, Top Speed reduced from 230 to 185 in version .69a2.\
* Received a remodel in version .75a5.\
== Trivia ==\
* The ship features six [[Spinals|cannon]] barrels but only fires two.\
* The '''Scimitar''' closely resembles some ships in the Galaxy on Fire game series.\
*Niari and Berger are weapons companies from Galaxy on Fire.\
*For a time after its remodel in .65b, it used to have only cannon spinals, shooting 2 and 4 for each spinal keybind. This was quickly fixed to shoot 2 cannons and 4 phasers.\
*Resembles the [[Guillotine]].\
*Based on the star trek scimitar\

The '''''Zillavik''''' is a powerful '''[[:Category:Limited|Limited]]''' '''[[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]''' which was added in the [[:Category:Halloween 2021|Halloween Event 2021]].\
\
<br />\
== Description ==\
The '''Zillavik''' is a small [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreadnought]] that shares design traits with the [[Nautilus]]. It can be obtained from the same place that Nautilus's quest was found before the event. It is a small, fast [[hull]]-shredder that is considered the strongest ship of its respective event.\
== Interior ==\
The interior is nothing more than a box with a teleporter and a seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Perfectly balanced healthpool.\
* High speed and small profile considering its class.\
* Very good [[Turrets|turret]] placement, almost no blind spots.\
* Extremely high damage to [[hull]].\
*Despite no [[Shields|shield]]-breaking turrets, it still does rather high damage to shields.\
*Large cargo for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreadnought]].\
*fast firing turrets\
== Disadvantages ==\
*Lacking in [[Shields|shield]] damage compared to [[hull]].\
*Shield damage requires good [[Spinal Weaponry|spinal]] aim.\
*Extremely expensive, being one of the most expensive ships in its event.\
*Limited, making it a large target for [[Pirating|pirates]].\
*Slow turnspeed for a ship with powerful spinals\
*Has some spots where only a few [[turrets]] can hit enemies.\
*The turrets don't have much range.\
== Strategy ==\
* Only use this ship alone when fighting ships that you are sure are weaker than you.\
* Avoid fights with ships that boast high [[Shields|shield]] health, like the [[Judgement]] and [[Lazarus]].\
* Use your high [[hull]] damage to decimate ships with high hull health such as [[Armageddon]].\
* Pair up with a shield-breaker like [[Crescendo]], [[Zeus]], or [[Sagittarius]], to boost your effectiveness in battle.\
== Version History ==\
* Price increased from 800,000 credits to 1,200,000 credits in version .74b3 (?)\
*Price reduced from 1,200,000 credits to 1,000,000 credits in .74b3.\

==Description==\
The '''Retro Cyclops '''is a limited version of the original [[Cyclops]] featuring the ship's original model and weapon loadout. Unlike the current version of the Cyclops, the '''Retro Cyclops''' is a [[:Category:Siege Ship|Siege]] ship, though it can still do well in [[:Category:PVP Ship|PvP]].\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Retro Cyclops''' consists of two nice-looking rooms. One room contains four sofas, and the other room contains another four sofas alongside two tables. The pilot's seat is at the front of the 2nd room.\
==Advantages==\
*Large, balanced health pool allows it to take a beating from enemy ships.\
*Long range [[Turrets]] allow it to attack targets from a distance.\
*Very high [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower; its high alpha damage (especially towards hull) and relatively low reload speed are a deadly combination.\
*Large cargo hold.\
*Good overall maneuverability. \
*Top mounted Turrets allow it to fire on enemy vessels and starbases from below.\
*Small for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*Inaccurate Turrets leave it prone to swarms.\
*Vulnerable bottom and rear.\
*Its expensive cost and [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] classification make it a huge target for pirates.\
==Strategy==\
* Stay under ships as much as possible, letting all your Turrets fire.\
* Siege [[Starbase]]s from afar (8k) with your [[Turrets|Heavy Alpha Railguns]].\
* Use it as you would use an [[Apocalypse]].\
==Version History==\
*Hull increased from 4000 to 6900 in version .68e.\
*Explosion Size 125 ----> 900 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
* Looks very much like the [[Mothership]] and is often referred to as a \"Mini\" Mothership.\
* Can capture [[Aqueous II]] in 2 minutes and 15 seconds.\
* Jeffenator_3000X was the first to lose one to Shad_owLord's [[Osiris]]. He rebought it 3 hours later.\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Beta Warlock''' is a turret-focused Battleship that uses an older model of the [[Warlock]]. It features a prominent circular ring of four thrusters, a feature characteristic of the older models of the Warlock. Its \"Beta\" name refers to the use of a slightly newer model, as the original Warlock model was more angular and blocky compared to the one used by this ship.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Beta Warlock''' is very long and narrow, requiring walking half the ship to get to the driver's seat, and the other half to get to the end. Upon entering the ship, there is a kitchen to the left with a sink, stove, and refrigerator, and 4 beds to the right. In the room with the pilot seat there is 4 other chairs, and in the hall going forward from the pilot room there is cargo crates lining the sides and at the end of it, 3 extra seats.\
== Advantages ==\
* Has very high turret dps combined with large cannon spinals.\
* Retro Medium Railguns give it a maximum range of 7125.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* High shield health and low hull health make it vulnerable to shield shredders such as [[Zeus]] and [[Sagittarius]].\
* Turret placement on the top of the ship gives it a big blindspot on the bottom, but this is only a minor vulnerability due to the high turnspeed and acceleration of the ship.\
* The ring makes it difficult for turrets to fire, especially at around 5k range.\
* Mostly hull armament makes it less effective against shield tanks such as [[Judgement]], [[Osiris]], and [[Obliterator]].\
== Strategy ==\
* Stay under and around 3k away from whatever you're firing at, making sure to fire your large cannons every now and then.\
* This battleship can easily take down other battleships and even some dreads due to its superior maneuverability and damage.\
* Only use it if backed up by people you 100% trust.\
== Version History ==\
* Explosion size 100 ----> 470 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* Is the only ship along with the Mini Beta Behemoth and Mini Beta Andromeda (as of the 2021 Retro Event) to have the \"Beta\" pronoun in its name.\

== Description ==\
The '''Discordite Cluster''' is a limited freighter that looks like an arrangement of light pink-colored crystals jutting out in one direction, looking similar to a comet or asteroid. The '''Discordite Cluster''' has a long pink trail with what appear to be sparkles along with it.\
\
==Interior==\
There is a seat inside the comet which a driver can sit on.\
\
== Advantages ==\
* Incredibly fast speed, highest speed out of any Freighter in the game.\
* Excellent health pool with more health than the [[Prepravca]].\
* Great for vulturing.\
* Most of the design is not solid, giving the vessel a tiny hitbox.\
* You don't have to keep boosting the server monthly to keep the ship.\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Will likely be a prime target for pirates due to its rarity and limited availability.\
* Costs $4.99 a month to have a server boost.\
\
== Strategy ==\
* Use your fast speed to be able to avoid pirate fire and [[Spinals]].\
* Only use this in specific situations, use a regular Freighter for regular activities.\
* Utilize this ship's tiny hitbox and incredible mobility to go close to enemy [[Starbase]]s and loot wrecks. Do not try that strategy on players, due to the likelihood of it being dived.\
\
== Version History ==\
* Added on 6/19/19 with a post on the Official Discord Server showing how to obtain it.\
* Stopped being distributed on 8/18/20 due to conflicts with the Roblox ToS.\
*Shields reduced from 3500 to 2500, Hull reduced from 3500 to 2000, Cargo Hold reduced from 3000 to 2475, Top Speed reduced from 250 to 200, Acceleration reduced from 50 to 40 and Turn Speed reduced from 0.45 to 0.35 in an unknown version.\
*Was made available again on 3/12/21 (version .72b).\
\
== Trivia ==\
*The only way to obtain this ship is “for those that have Nitro Boosted the [https://discordapp.com/invite/FCGGXvk discord server]”.\
*The first player to have their '''Discordite Cluster''' destroyed was Nighthunter313 to a VC fleet.\
*Only one of these was given to someone who did not boost the discord server, and that was u00854, who was the first person that found the [[Remains of U.N.E Starbase 12]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Spectre''' is an uncommon [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]]-class ship. It's oriented towards a [[Spinals|Spinal]]-heavy chaser profile, as its weapons help to quickly finish off the [[Shields|Shield]] and deal heavy damage to the [[Hull]] at the same time.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Spectre's''' interior consists of nothing more than a short but detailed room containing the pilot's seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Powerful spinals.\
* Good mobility making it a great escort.\
* High shield damage.\
* Fairly evened out pool of health between the shields and the hull.\
* Flat size makes it hard to hit.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Only has a single [[Turrets|Light Turret]].\
* Quite large for its class.\
* Little Kinetic weaponry making it less effective against hull.\
* Hard to use if you're not used to [[Spinals]].\
* Out-gunned by ships with stronger Spinals or lots of high accuracy weapons.\
* Loses to smaller and more agile ships if the pilot is unskilled.\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship has high maneuverability but fairly low defense, so exploiting the enemy's blind spot is vital.\
* Use the spinals, as almost all of the firepower is in them.\
* Use in swarms of many [[Ships]] at a time. Four or more '''Spectre''''s can bring down a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] with proper use.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a slight remodel in an unknown update.\
* One Light Laser Turret removed in an unknown version.\
* Received two extra [[Spinals|Small Phaser]] spinals in version .68e.\
* Remodeled in version .68e.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* Old model used in the teaser image on the Roblox game page, along with the [[Archangel]] and [[Warlock]].\
* It was one of the ships chosen for the [[Halloween Event 2018]], this time as the [[Ghost]].\

*Marauder Speed increased (65 -> 90) Marauder Acceleration increased (25 -> 30) .75a12\

* The name of the ship used to have a space before it. That meant that players must add an extra space when using the :cost command. It also meant that the ship appears on the top of the \"spawn ship\" list because of alphabetical order. (this is probably fixed?)\
*A [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] called the [[Warlord]] has a design that looks very similar to this ship; also, a Fighter called the [[Harbinger]], which is found exclusively on the [[Prometheus]], shares a similar model.\

The '''Retro Commercial Miner''' has almost no interior. There is just a large glass cockpit with one seat, no detail, and a floor with a metallic texture. The [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] docks with the cockpit facing the terminal.\
\
== Advantages ==\
*5 [[Turrets|Retro Medium Mining Lasers]] provide a mining rate faster than that of the [[Orca]].\
*Decent amount of health.\
*Large Ore Hold.\
*Can mine multiple [[Ores]] at once.\
*High speed for its size.\
*High survivability because of its speed and decent amount of health.\
== Disadvantages ==\
\
*Relatively expensive.\
*[[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
*Fairly large for its class and easy to hit.\
*[[Pirating|Pirates]] may declare [[War]] in order to destroy a more expensive and limited [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
*Due to the model and turret placement, some may find it awkward with the angles you may need to use to mine with all turrets at once.\
== Strategy ==\
*Check the [[Minimap]] every 30 seconds for pirates or other foes.\
*Try to mine near your [[Starbase]] to decrease the chance of your ship being shot down.\
*Never mine in a [[War]].\
*Mine in a Private Server if you have access to one.\
\
== Version History ==\
*Added in version .73a3 as part of the 2021 Retro Ship Event.\
*Ore Hold buffed from 2500 to 3250, Turn Speed nerfed from 0.8 to 0.55, Acceleration buffed from 10 to 40 after the Retro Event ended.\
\
== Trivia ==\
\
*This ship can mine broadside. Most of the [[Turrets|Mining Lasers]] are on the left side of the ship once you sit down.\

== Description ==\
The '''Vampire X-R4''' is a sleek [[:Category:Cruiser|cruiser]]; something of a ''Formula'' racer in space. It has two small, wedge-like wings in the front and a set of four X-shaped wings in the back, hence the name \"X-R4.\" This ship is also one of few ships in the game to rely heavily on textures for its model.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Vampire X-R4''' is a simple cockpit with a display.\
== Advantages ==\
* Tied with [[Stealth Recon]] as the 3rd fastest non-[[:Category:Admin|admin ship]] in the game, excluding [[:Category:Fighters|fighters]], only the [[Prototype X1|Prototype X/1]] and [[Coal Wasp]] have higher top speed.\
* Decent damage balance, somewhat focused on [[Shields]].\
* Nearly impossible to kill, due to the combination of high speed and high health, especially for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]]. This makes it one of the most powerful distractor ships in the game.\
*Good damage output for a Cruiser.\
*\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Expensive for a Cruiser.\
*Relies on spinal aiming to deal any damage.\
*Although it is maneuverable, it is easy to bleed off a large portion of your speed while turning and become vulnerable.\
== Strategy ==\
* Drift around enemy ships while firing [[Spinals]].\
*Distract Starbase turrets at close ranges during sieges.\
*Use the high turn speed to easily dodge turret fire.\
== Version History ==\
* Spinal count increased from 1 set of 2 Medium Phasers to 2 sets of 3 Medium Phasers in version .72e1\
*One set of Spinals switched from Phasers to Cannons, top speed buffed from 296 to 350, and acceleration buffed from 29 to 35 in version .75a\
== Trivia ==\
* Added in the 1st part the Halloween 2020 Event.\
* The Vampire X-R4 is mainly known for the extreme maneuverability.\
* The first person to lose this ship was ''wayken70''. It was destroyed by ''TwoHeadedOrthrus''<nowiki/>'s [[Nightmare]].\
* You only need to kill 5 [[Alien Serv]]s to have enough [[Gamma Pumpkin]]s for this ship.\
*The current model for [[Spectating Ship]] is based on this ship.\
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a E class permit (310k credits) + 934 Sillicate, 712 Carbon, 579 Iridium along with 1346 manufacturing fee.\

== Description ==\
The '''Gideon''' is a low-cost, turret-focused cruiser with decent speed and maneuverability which makes it a good ship for escorting larger ships and fending off smaller ships such as frigates and fighters.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior contains a pilot's seat that you will see if you go through the entry door. Behind the pilot's seat, there's a very tiny passage leading to a double-seated sofa allowing you to transport 2 players. In front, there is a screen with \"Oblivion\" Written on it.\
== Advantages ==\
* Low cost.\
* Great amount of turrets for a cruiser.\
* Decent speed and mobility.\
* Great [[Turrets|Turret]] placement.\
* High health.\
*High speed allows it to get to blind spots easily.\
*Great ship for new players.\

== Strategy ==\
* Support fleets in battle.\
* Fend off smaller ships.\
* Harass [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] or [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]], or other bigger, slower ships.\
* Destroy [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] by teaming up with others.\
* Always rotate your ship so that all the weapons can aim at the enemy.\
* Good for killing [[Aliens]].\
* Try and get underneath enemy ships as most of your [[Turrets]] are located on the top of the ship.\
== Version History ==\
* Buffed In Version .52, got 1 [[Turrets|Flak Cannon]] and a mobility boost.\
* Nerfed in .54 with the removal of a light [[Turrets|Laser Turret]].\
* It got a remodel in .60d.\
* Recolored and gained a Light Gatling Laser in version .66b\
== Trivia ==\
* Before the game went into [BETA], the most used ship to [[Pirating|Pirate]] with was the Gideon. It still remains somewhat popular in such a role.\
* Many experienced players call this the \"[[Cobra]]-killer\".\
* This ship used to have [[Spinals]] when first added.\
* Can fit three people, one in the pilot seat and two in the sofa in the back.\

}}\
==Description==\
The '''Golden Viper''' is, as the name suggests, a golden recolor of the [[Viper]]. Like the [[Patriotic Viper]], it sports torpedoes with a unique mesh and trail at the front of the ship. According to the description of the ship, it is these torpedoes that give the ship its [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]] classification. \
\
==Interior==\
For the most part, the '''Golden Viper''' has the same interior as its regular counterpart. That being said, it does feature some minor differences, such as a red metallic seat and a decal as the screen.\
\
==Advantages==\
\
* Contains 2 [[Spinal Weaponry|Small Torpedoes]].\
* High Acceleration and Turn Speed\
* Very fast for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
* High Hull health.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
\
* Unlike its [[Viper|regular counterpart]], it is a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
* Very expensive for a ship of its class.\
* Much slower than the [[Viper]], its regular counterpart.\
* Low shield, making it weaker to hull breakers.\
*The second torpedo is delayed after the first, which may throw off your aim.\
\
==Strategy==\
\
*<s>Flex your wealth with this ship.</s>\
*Try to avoid ships like the [[Mjolnheimr]] that are equipped for destroying small ships.\
* Use the long range of the torpedoes during a [[Sieging|Siege]] or when swarming large ships.\
* Utilize the ships impressive speed for evasion.\
* While it can be devastating in swarms, it's probably not worth risking this ship unless if you're confident that you'll make it out alive.\
\
==Version History==\
*Received a recolor in version .69e.\
\
==Trivia==\
\
__NOTOC__\
\
* Its torpedoes are golden.\
* Was one of only two limited ships to be featured in the [[Black Friday Event 2020]].\
* Only limited thus far to feature exclusively in a Black Friday event.\
* Prior to the recolor, its turbines uniquely had a reflective surface.\
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a E class permit (310k credits) + 264 Sillicate, 184 Carbon, 111 Iridium, 29 Adamantite, 27 Palladium, 26 Titanium, 26 Quantium, and 17Uranium\

==Description==\
The Last Signal is a quest that is required to build the Kneall Core.\
\
'''''Nautilus Wreck''''' is the quest giver NPC that allows players to start [[Quests|Quest]] #202, \"The Last Signal\". which allows players to acquire the 1 count of \"Kneall Core\" which is required to build the [[Obliterator]].\
\
'''''IMPORTANT NOTE: The quest can only be completed once, and CANNOT work in Private Servers.'''''\
\
The Items that the quest needs to build the Kneall Core are the following: \
*6 [[Armored Plating]]\
*3 [[Artifacts|Antimatter Shards]]\
*2 [[Alien Device]]\
*1 [[Artifacts|Ascension Crystal]]\
*1 [[Quantum Core]]\
==Location==\
The '''Nautilus Wreck''' can be found somewhere around the [[Mega Base]] with a radius of 70k+ Studs. It always spawns beside a pile of ship wrecks ([[U.N.E Battle of Sector 552 Wreckage|Ship Wrecks of Sector 552]]) which is simpler to spot.\
\
To find it, you must first find the [[Punisher]] wreck at the bottom of the Wreckages, then find a [[Swarmer]] beside it, then find the direction of the [[Swarmer]] where it is pointing at the Nautilus Wreck at its backside with its wrecked thrusters. Then travel 10k in the direction from where the back of the [[Swarmer]] is facing. ''(Note that the Nautilus Wreck is quite challenging to spot even with this guide)''\

== Description  ==\
The '''Arthur''' is a fast [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] with a very unique shape. It is a very balanced ship (in terms of firepower) divided into both [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]], and it has a decent amount of health for its class. It also has great speed and maneuverability for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Arthur''' does not have an interior, and it is entered by falling straight through the cockpit into the pilot's seat.\
== Advantages ==\
*High firepower if you can aim the [[Spinals]].\
*Decent [[Turrets|Turret]] placement.\
*Good turn speed makes it so enemy ships stay out of its blind spot.\
*Good hull damage.\
*Good maneuverability.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* [[Spinals]] are key to doing shield damage.\
* Can't use all [[Turrets]] when firing [[Spinals]].\
* Vulnerable from the topside.\
* Weak [[Hull]] health.\
== Strategy ==\
*If you have more than 4 people in your faction and a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] shows up at your [[Starbase]], the Arthur would be a good ship to swarm with because of its relatively low cost, high speeds, and good [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]].\
*Only use it to support your faction's fleet; never go near a [[Starbase]] as it will rip you apart.\
*Use it to destroy smaller ships and harass larger ships.\
*If going alone, use hit and run tactics. Strike your enemy hard, return to your [[Starbase]] for repairs, and repeat.\
*If attempting a 1v1 battle, make sure that your enemy is a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] or lower class. Use the '''Arthur's''' maneuverability to find your enemy's blindspot and stay there.\
== Version History ==\
* The original [[Turrets|Turret]] placement of the '''Arthur''' had two [[Turrets|Flaks]] on the top and three on the bottom. In version ??? all of the [[Turrets]] were moved to the bottom.\
== Trivia ==\
*Some new players tend to take this into battle alone, most likely overestimating this ship's power.\

Its armed to the teeth with railgun turrets that will tear apart the hull of most ships, and equipped with balanced spinal firepower to retain effective shield damage output.\
==Interior==\
The interior is a box, with a red pilot seat.\
==Advantages==\
* Great kinetic turret armament allows you to shred the hull of crippled ships, while the spinals support the low shield damage output.\
* Very few blind-spots.\
* Unusual profile can make it difficult for Large or Huge-sized [[Turrets]] to hit you.\
* Good cargo hold.\
* Decent health pool.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Limited classification means it will be targeted very often.\
* Railgun focused turret armament means accuracy issues, especially with the Avellian Spike-L turrets which possess multiple barrels.\
* Unbalanced health (4250/3000).\
* Sluggish maneuverability compared to some other Battleships.\
* Almost as expensive as a [[Ridgebreaker]].\
* Mediocre shield damage.\
==Strategy==\
* Do not use this ship in a battle unless you are sure your ship won't be at risk of being destroyed.\
* '''Avoid''' shield breakers like the [[Zeus]], [[Warden]], and [[Sagittarius]].\
* Do not sustain heavy fire; if you do, retreat to your nearest own or allied base.\
==Version History==\
* Got a box interior in version .75a1; The seat was previously on top of the ship.\
* Turret line of sight fixed, and spinals heavily nerfed: 8 Large Cannons un-multigunned and merged into a single barrel of 4 Medium Cannons and 4 Medium Phasers(resulting in a large reduction to hull damage output), in version .75a1. \
*Explosion size 250 ----> 510 .75a12 \

== Description  ==\
The '''Viking''' is a Limited Event ship for the [[Christmas Event 2017|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Christmas 2017 Event</span>]] which was modeled after the [[Centurion]]. The outside is an ice-blue color with many blue ice shards protruding from various parts of the ship. (Has a nice beard as well).\
==Interior==\
The interior is very basic.\
== Advantages ==\
* High hull damage.\
* It has a Medium [[Spinals|Torpedo]] for sieges and that can do high damage.\
* [[Turrets|Turret]] placement ensures no blind spots.\
* It has very high health for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]] class ship.\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Very slow for a Destroyer-class.\
* Torpedo is difficult to aim.\
* Low [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
* Once it is destroyed, it is gone forever, unless it becomes available on the limited menu or you get a refund for it being lost to bugs/hackers. (Must have video and/or photo proof)\
* Costly for a Destroyer.\
\
== Strategy ==\
* Fire Torpedoes from outside of the base range. Medium-sized Torpedoes can hit from a range of 10000.\
* Useful in fleets for helping to destroy bases and ships.\
* Chase down [[hull]]ed ships and use your high-damage [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]] to finish them off.\
\
== Version History ==\
* Shortly after .60 was released, this ship got a remodel.\
* \".61+\" saw the replacement of 2 of the 4 Light Flak Cannons with 2 Light Cannons.\
* Buffed in .64f to have a total of 4 Light Cannons and replaced Light Flak Cannons with 2 Medium Flak Cannons.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* This ship was made for the Christmas Event 2017.\
* The name '''Viking''' may be attributed to the offense-oriented design of the ship.\
* '''Vikings''' were warriors from Scandinavia that are best known for arriving in slim boats with carved figureheads and wreaking havoc across Europe.\
* For a limited period of time after the Christmas Event 2017, the ship was able to be built for nearly half of its original value (the reason for this remains unknown).\

==Description==\
The ''Dimensional Cache'' is a quest that gives the item [[Dimensional Alloy]], and is currently the only source.\
\
'''''Archive''''' is the quest giver NPC that allows players to start Quest 201, \"Dimensional Cache\". which allows players to acquire the 12 counts of \"Dimensional Alloy\" which is required to build exceptionally powerful ships.\
\
Archive looks like a small interface on a wall of 'ancient ruins' with a resemblance of a sort of advanced round camera. This interface mentions the Golden Age and gives gifts if the quest is completed.\
\
The Items that the quest needs to make 10 Dimensional Alloys are the following:\
*12 [[Armored Plating]]\
* 50000 Credits\
* 1 [[Antimatter Shard]]\
==Location==\
'''Archive''' is found deep inside [[Aqueous II]] in a foggy cave, in which it's entrance is in one of the cracks in one of the Planet's side near Terminal A, a statue of Sean Morabito and a wreck of a [[Wyrm]]. \
\
Once the entrance is found, players can then walk into the crack and be teleported deep inside the planet. The fog is dense inside the cave as seen in the one of the pictures. The player must walk along a maze and choose the right paths to reach an ancient ruined structure where the Archive NPC can be found and accessed. To navigate the maze, the player at the start takes a right turn, then walk over one bridge, then take a left turn, then walk straight forward (''Beware of broken planks, jump over them).''\

<h2> Overview</h2>\
The '''Kneall event''' is an event that started in May 28th, 2022 and concluded at June 6, 2022. It introduced new ships, a large [[Kneall]] base, and a new mini-boss.\
\
=== '''Part 1''' ===\
\
* Introduced a large [[Kneall]] base \"[[Kneall Outpost]]\", which had an enormous amount of health and spawned large amounts of [[Aliens]] near it, that is located roughly 30k studs away from [[Mega Base]]. \
* The [[Kneall Prototype]]'s spawns were enabled and spawned every 120 minutes but stopped spawning after the conclusion of Part 1.\
\
=== '''Part 2''' ===\
\
* Introduced 2 new ships in the game, the [[Punisher]]-based counterpart, the [[Onslaught]] and the most well-known ship added for the event, the [[Annihilator]]. \
* Introduced the new Alien mini-boss, the [[Kneall Brawler]], and the [[Devastator]], which was an extremely powerful [[Aliens|Alien]] [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] which itself significantly increased the spawn rate of ships like [[Swarmer|Swarmers]], [[Bruiser|Bruisers]] and [[Outrider|Outriders]]. The Devastator base is famous for having an absolutely devastating nuke, capable of destroying entire fleets in a moment.\
* During this part there was a ''very'' significant increase in [[U.N.E]] ship spawns in public servers, this also included ships like [[Sovereign-X|Sovereigns]], [[Judgement|Judgements]] and [[U.N.E Subjugator|Subjugators]].\
* The [[Kneall Outpost]] was also no longer a functional [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] but instead, was made a portal for the [[Kneall]] Fleet to come and invade from. \
* Planets were removed midway into Part 2 due to players using them as bait for [[Aliens]] to attack. Some Planet-based [[Pyramus#Quests|Quests]] were moved to [[Mega Base]] due to this.\
* Many [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]]-class ships' HP nerfed.\
\
=== '''Part 3''' ===\
\
* Nerfed [[Devastator]] to the point where it could be soloed by a skilled player, but the loot was also nerfed from 1m+ to 248k.\
* [[:Category:Planets|Planets]] could now spawn again naturally in the map and [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] nerfs reverted.\
\
* Re-released the [[Disruptor]] and [[Brawler]] in the Non-Limited Build menu.\
* ''Kneall Event concludes after this part.''\
\
== Ships ==\
<h3> '''Part 1 Ships'''</h3>\
None.\
<h3>'''Part 2 Ships''' </h3>\
\
<h3>'''Part 3 Ships''' </h3>\
\
\
== Trivia ==\
\
* Kneall Core was one of the loot in [[Devastator]], which was the material needed to build the [[Obliterator]], and could only be obtained once via a [[The Last Signal|quest]]. This made [[Obliterator]]<nowiki/>non-limited during the event.\

== Description ==\
The '''Sturm''' is a PVP Battlecruiser. It has [[Turrets|Small Turrets]] protruding from its sides and thruster pod. It can deal massive damage with its [[Spinals]], but lacks health as a form of compensation. The '''Sturm''' is one of the fastest Battlecruisers in the game and the most expensive.\
== Appearance ==\
There is no longer an interior as the ship now has the dreaded forward facing dock, the cockpit having been moved directly to the front of the ship inside of a poorly thought out open cabin.\
== Advantages ==\
* Highest acceleration of any Battlecruiser, aside from the [[Zhen]] and [[Acolyte]].\
* Powerful [[Spinals]].\
* Can deal massive damage if used correctly.\
* 3rd fastest [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] in the game, being beaten in speed by the [[Aeaphiel]] and Zhen.\
* Excellent mobility.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low [[shields]] and [[hull]] for a Battlecruiser.\
* Being able to aim with the ship's Spinals is crucial to do decent damage.\
* The most expensive Battlecruiser in the game besides the Zhen and [[Dullahan]].\
* Despite its speed, it has a rather large size for a ship its class.\
*Somewhat hard to get in the seat, due to the turret near the cockpit.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use this ship for pirating, as it's speed and firepower gives you an advantage over defenseless Freighters.\
* Always keep an eye on the minimap, as a high-firepower ship such as a Dreadnought or Battleship could easily destroy you.\
* Make hiding in blindspots your first priority, and use your high mobility to stay there, because what good is high firepower if someone evaporates your small health pool.\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled in version .66b.\
* Remodeled in version .69a2.\
== Trivia ==\
*Not seen very often, if at all.\
*Currently the most expensive [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] on the build menu.\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Hellkeeper''' is a pirate [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] boss with dark red, black, and glowing orange coloring. Its model has various horns, ribs, and other sharp, curved features. Its various turrets float as translucent red orbs above each turret pad and are largely top-mounted, allowing players to fly small ships underneath the '''Hellkeeper''' while remaining out of its line of fire.\
\
==Behavior==\
The '''Hellkeeper''' is similar to the [[Kodiak]] in that it can call [[Pirates|Pirate]] ships to its side for reinforcements and will chase the player. If the '''Hellkeeper''' isn't chasing the player ''(which happens often)'', then the [[Dissonance]]s will. It will attack ANYTHING except [[Starbase|Starbases]] and other [[Pirates]].\
\
==Loot==\
*200 Souls ''(Takes up 20k cubic meters of cargo space, which will require 2 runs with an [[E Class]] to fully loot the Hellkeeper's wreck)''\
\
==Strategy==\
*'''DO NOT TAKE THIS ON ALONE''' ''UNLESS'' YOU LURE IT TO A BASE OR USE A CARRIER.\
*Make sure to destroy the [[Dissonance|Pirate Dissonance]] fleet before attacking the '''Hellkeeper.'''\
* Lure it to a high-level [[Starbase]] or the [[Mothership|Mothership.]]\
*Alternatively, use a carrier with high damage fighters ''([[Nyx]], [[Rhino]], [[Prometheus]], etc)'' if AI fighters are available or you have a large faction of players willing to listen to your orders.\
*Use ships with high [[Hull]] health such as [[Armageddon]] and [[Blackgate]], because the '''Hellkeeper''' is a shield-breaking ship. ''(Avoid the spinals for less [[Hull]] damage)''\
*The '''Hellkeeper''' has a huge blind spot right below it. Try to stay in that spot as much as you can, just be aware of the speed of it.\
\
==Version History==\
* Added during the '''[[:Category:Halloween 2021|2021 Halloween Event.]]'''\
*Minimum amount of players required for it to spawn reduced from 7 to 4 in version .74a10.\
*Buffed in version .74b3 -- CrescendaB reload significantly reduced, CrescendaB damage reduced, CrescendaB range reduced, Huge Cannon count doubled, gained 4 Huge Phasers.\
*Top speed increased to 300 and Turn speed increased to 0.22 in version .74b4.\
\
==Trivia==\
\
* Gives 100k-110k '''[[Credits]]''' in combat rewards if you destroy it alone.\
* Gives 200 ''souls'' which equal 60k-80k '''Credits''' considering they cost 300-400 '''Credits''' each.\
*Has a player counterpart, the [[Crescendo]], which is a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] instead.\

== Description ==\
The '''Advanced Miner''' is a Miner with four Small Mining Lasers. This allows it to mine [[Ores|Asteroids]] at double the rate of a [[Tango]], It has a health pool of 2200, divided rather evenly between [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] (1000/1200) respectively. It has a mining range of approximately 4000 studs. It takes a minimum of 100 seconds to fill up its Ore Hold.\
== Appearance ==\

== Advantages ==\
* Fast mining speed.\
* Somewhat large Ore Hold.\
* Decent mobility for a Miner.\
* Explosion Value of 28\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Somewhat low health (2200 total).\
* Can be easily taken down with any ship if you are not under your [[Starbase|Starbase's]] protection.\
== Strategy ==\

* Always mine in a faction that is not at [[War]] with anyone so you can make sure you will be safe.\
* Stay near your base so that you can make it back quickly if someone declares War.\
== Version History ==\
* Warp drive added in an unknown version (.61h1?)\
*Alongside the [[Harvester]], this ship was put off sale in version .75a10.\
*\
== Trivia ==\
* The current model is based on the Venture Mining frigate from the game ''Eve Online''.\
* Before the second and the third model was made, the '''Advanced Miner''' was formerly a modified [[Tango]] with 4 Small Mining Lasers.\
* Brings in about 1250 [[Credits]] without any [[Loyalty]] per run, but can earn up to 2250.\
* A popular choice for new players.\
* There is a hidden Fortnite shoe inside this ship.\
* Has two limited counterparts, the [[Snowy Advanced Miner]] and the [[Retro Advanced Miner]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Fury''' is a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter Class]] ship that is highly maneuverable and is able to deal around 200 damage to [[Shields]] with a well-aimed Phaser volley. It used to be available in the '''[[Stormbringer]]''' and '''[[Revelation]],''' but has since been replaced their respective custom fighters following remodels'''.'''It can only be found now in a level 4 [[Mothership]]. A stronger variant of this ship, the '''[[Starbase Fury]],''' can be found in the fighter bays of level 2-5 [[Starbase]]s.\
\
'''Fury''' [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] are small and are about the size of a [[Wasp]]. Furies can fire a volley up to 4 [[Spinals|Phasers]] through its 2 [[Spinals|Phaser]] batteries. Its appearance is similar to that of a fighter jet.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Fury''''s interior is entered through its cockpit window. Inside, there is a single seat behind a steering column.\
== Advantages ==\
* Can deal a great concentration of damage to an enemy's [[Ships]] [[Shields|shield]] if used correctly.\
* Fast and highly maneuverable making it hard for bigger ships to destroy.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Easily hit by [[Ships]] with [[Turrets|Light Turrets]].\
* Extremely low health.\
== Strategy ==\
* '''Furies''' are usually used to swarm a large ship or provide cover in sieges. A skilled swarm of furies can obliterate a ship's Shield health within 30 seconds, leaving it to be easily finished off. The strategy with '''Furies''' is to dive-bomb if the target is large, or slow down and wait for your target to move into a vulnerable position if they're too fast or small.\
* Deal as much damage as possible before being destroyed by your target. Fire your [[Spinals]] as often as possible.\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled in an unknown version.\
* Remodeled again in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Fury''' was the third [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter-Class]] ship that was added to the game, following the [[Dragonfly]] and [[Xenophile]].\
* Has a more powerful counterpart, the [[Starbase Fury]], that spawns only in level 2-5 Starbases.\
* Has a lighter counterpart, called a [[Frenzy]], that has less armor and slightly more speed. Frenzies also have a black hull where as furies have a slight grey hull.\

== Description ==\
The '''Commercial Miner''' is a [[Mining]] ship with very little interior but a large Ore Hold, designed to mine multiple [[Ores]] at once with fair efficiency. It is a large jump in price from the more affordable [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] like the [[Industrial Miner]]. It takes a minimum of 240 seconds to fill up its Ore Hold.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Commercial Miner''' has almost no interior. There is just a large glass cockpit with one seat, no detail, and a floor with a metallic texture. The [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] docks with the cockpit facing the terminal.\
== Advantages ==\
*5 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] provide quick mining speeds.\
*Decent amount of health.\
*Large Ore Hold.\
*Can mine multiple [[Ores]] at once.\
*High speed for its size.\
*High survivability because of its speed and decent amount of health.\
== Disadvantages ==\
*Relatively expensive.\
*[[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
*Fairly large for its class and easy to hit.\
*[[Pirating|Pirates]] may declare [[War]] in order to destroy a more expensive and loot-filled [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
*[[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] have shorter range compared to [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]].\
== Strategy ==\
*Check the [[Minimap]] every 30 seconds for pirates or other foes.\
*Try to mine near your [[Starbase]] to decrease the chance of your ship being shot down.\
*Never mine in a [[War]].\
*Mine in a Private Server if you have access to one.\
== Version History ==\
* Was added in update .61g\
* .61h1? - [[Warp Drive]] added.\
* Explosion range decreased from 80 to 60 in .65b\
* Two [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] switched out with a [[Turrets|Medium Mining Laser]] in version .68e.\
* Received a remodel in version .69a2.\
*Ore hold was nerfed from 3000 to 2500.\
*Ore Hold increased back to 3000 from 2500 in version .72e1(?)\

==Description==\
The '''Incarnate''' is a powerful event Dreadnought able to decimate any ships of its class and lower that dares to take on this ship.\
==Interior==\
Not much in the way of an interior simply a teleporter pad very close to the driver seat.\
==Advantages==\
* High overall DPS for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
* Relatively high alpha damage, at 2352 to [[Shields]] and 3240 to [[Hull]]. \
* Balanced damage to Shields and Hull\
* Overall high mobility for its class\
* A combined total health of 14,666 means it can tank damage quite well.\
* High turret range of 8000 studs.\
*Rather high cargo hold for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
==Disadvantages==\
* Very expensive costing over a million credits in build materials plus the exorbitant cost of a [[Permits|C Permit]].\
* Was only available during the [[Halloween Event 2020]] and can only be obtained again on limited rotation with the use of a C Class [[Permits|Permit]].\
*Terrible accuracy making this only useful for killing battleships-or-above or destroying a base.\
*Weak against smaller/faster ships.\
==Strategy==\
* Use this ship only against bigger ships.\
* Make sure to check the map/leaderboard once in awhile while using this ship to watch out for raids to kill your ship; limited dreadnoughts are both a blessing of a powerful ship and a curse of trophy hunting.\
==Version History==\
*2 [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Cannons]] removed in version .70b2.\
*Reverted the Huge Cannon amount back to 4 in version .72d.\
*[[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] split from single 4-barrel Huge Cannon to dual 2-barrel Huge Cannons in version .72f1\
*Explosion Size 500 ----> 830 .75a12\
==Trivia==\

* There are [[Kneall]] letters which translates to \"UNE08 CORRUPTED\"\
*There are multiple [[U.N.E Starbase|U.N.E]] flags all over the ship.\

*Flat, making it hard for large, inaccurate turrets to hit.\
*Very small for its class.\
*Extremely powerful nuke, if using this ship as a kamikaze is your intention.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Lacks powerful hull-based damage.\
*Small blindspot at the back of the ship.\
*Will be targeted due to it being a limited ship.\
==Strategy==\
* Plays more like a battlecruiser than a battleship.\
*Circle your target in confusing patterns, making it harder for them to hit you.\
*Use in a swarm with other '''''Revenants''''' and [[Valkerac]]s to create a truly terrifying storm of shield-obliteration.\
*Use this as a very powerful shield breaker if you do not want to use anything larger, since most people don’t know much about it and will lose their shields too quickly to retaliate. Be very careful however, since it is limited.\
==Version History==\
* Souls required reduced from 150 to 100, accidentally moved into the limited build menu (with a Class D Permit) in version .74a9. Shortly moved back to the normal build menu, as its respective event was not over.\
*Explosion size 300 ----> 500 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*Has its own unique ambience, which is notorious for being extremely loud and annoying.\
*Used to have a bugged seat, which would sometimes prevent you from exiting. This was a reason for many '''''Revenants''''' being destroyed before it was fixed, as they could not leave the ship. Another bug involved the '''Revenant''' flipping over repeatedly at ridiculous speeds when you try to turn or move, but it was later fixed. Now the model is so broken that it appears to just be multiple white boxes arranged in the shape of a '''Revenant''', with the pilot completely open to space. This has earned it the nickname “3D Printed Revenant”.\

==Description==\
The '''Hecate''' can deal significant Hull damage. The '''Hecate's''' exterior features two primary engines, two large fins, and two sets of six [[Spinals|Medium Cannon]] barrels. It was the first ship with [[Turrets|Medium Flaks]]. (Now replaced with [[Turrets|Dual Gatlings]], and then Tiny Lasers)\
==Interior==\
The current design's interior is very empty. You enter using a door in the side, revealing an empty room with nothing but a pilot's seat and a long window at the front.\
==Advantages==\
*[[Spinals]] do a lot of hull damage.\
*[[Turrets]] deal out tons of shield damage against smaller [[ships]].\
*Powerful Hull damage.\
*High cargo for its class.\
*Can support various roles such as PvP, support, and chasing.\
*Good speed and maneuverability.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Vulnerable bottom.\
*[[Spinals]] have a slow fire rate.\
*Lacking in [[Shields|shield]] damage.\
*Expensive for a battlecruiser.\
*Requires [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP.]]\
*Bad placement of [[Turrets]];\
==Strategy==\
*Overall, this ship should really only be used to chase down hulled ships.\
*This ship does not perform well alone against multiple small ships. Stay with a fleet.\
*Use this ship in sieges. Its [[Spinals|Cannons]] deal high hull damage and it is capable of taking down other [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]], such as the [[Dire Wolf]]. It can even challenge some [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] such the [[Cutlass]].\
==Version History==\
* Remodeled in .61h.\
*Remodeled and rebalanced<sup>(Please add statistic changes here)</sup> in version .74b14.\
==Trivia ==\
*This is the third '''Hecate''' model in the game.\
*The new model is very different from the old one.\
*This ship is very rare as most people don't even notice it or use it.\
* Design\
*First ship in the game with [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannons]].\
*Hecate is the Greek goddess of magic.\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Retro Aegis''' is rather large for a [[Ships|Battleship]] with two large blast shields at it side wielding amazing shield shredding capabilities.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Retro Aegis''' starts with a walkway into a large hallway with many windows on both sides along with many rooms and seats at the end along with a ramp going up to the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor is just like the first floor has many windows and a large open hallway leading to the pilot seat and the control consul. The 3rd floor is just a hallway with large windows going across.\
== Advantages ==\
* Above average shield health.\
* Amazing turn speed.\
* High top speed of 80.\
* High turret DPS of 272.\
* Surprisingly costs less than its non limited counterpart the Aegis coming in at 108,478 credits\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Weak hull integrity, which makes it very fragile without shields.\
* Due to the turrets only being located at the front, this ship has poor line of sight at the sides and rear of the ship.\
* Limited classification, making this a high priority target.\
* No kinetic weaponry of any sort, making for very poor damage to hull.\
\
* <u>Extremely</u> weak to shield breakers, and effectively counters itself.\
\
* Worse than the Warden in every way.\
== Strategy ==\
* Team up with a hullbreaker ship, as your shield-melting armament will help a lot when combined with the kinetic weaponry of another ship.\
* '''NEVER''' attempt to tank in this ship, it does not have the durability to do so. Instead, let a Dreadnought or a battleship with better durability tank instead.\
* Much like it's normal counterpart, it's hull is fragile so disengage from a fight before you're hulled(ideally 1k or 1.5k shield HP).\
* If you see a shield breaker like the [[Warden]] or [[Zeus]] approaching you, run as fast as you can back to the nearest neutral or friendly starbase.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in version .73a3 as part of the 2021 Retro Ship Event.\
*Gained teleporters and Shields/Hull increased from 4000/700 to 5000/1500 after the event ended.\
*Explosion size 65 ----> 460 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* This ship is the old version of the Aegis.\
* The '''Retro''' '''Aegis''' looks similar to the Ankylon Titan from Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. \

== Description ==\
The '''Prowler''' is a moderately fast battleship that is incredibly cheap, [[Hull]]-breaking and durable.\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Prowler''' is detailed, with black and grey striped walls, a black floor with grey studs, and a black computer terminal with a holographic model of the ship in front of it, resembling the interior of the [[Galaxy]].\
==Advantages==\
*While not overly fast for its class, it does retain decent speed while also having fair firepower.\
*Turns and accelerates rather quickly, giving it the feeling that it's faster than it really is.\
*The cheapest Battleship available.\
*Great for finishing off ships via Capital Cannon.\
*Decent healthpool.\
==Disadvantages==\
*The armament is directed more towards [[Hull]] breaking, it is rather ineffectual against small [[Ships]].\
*Has a large profile, allowing it to be hit easily.\
*Somewhat slow compared to other battleships.\
*If you can't hit the spinals, shield damage is really low.\
==Strategy==\
*Use the turn speed to keep all [[Turrets]] pointed on your enemy as you use the phasers to wear down their [[Shields]].\
*Avoid PvP with larger, more powerful [[Ships]], as well as maneuverable smaller [[Ships]].\
*It is a very resistant battleship, this means it could tank more than other battleships.\
*If you are fighting a big or medium ship, your turrets can easily pick on its hull rather quick.\
*Use this ship to finish off other ships as its cannon weaponry will decimate hull quickly and has enough health to dive a ship back to its starbase.\
==Version History==\
* Immediately nerfed upon addition in version .66b—Cargo Hold reduced from 1,750 to 200.\
* Buffed in .66b, increasing its shield from 4500 to 4550 and its hull from 3350 to 3650\
* [[Shields]] reduced to 3000 and [[Hull]] reduced to 3350 in version .69a1.\
* Part-shift fixed on the ship model in version .75a5.\
*Explosion Size 80 ----> 290 .75a12\
== Trivia  ==\
* Was originally planned to be a ship for Halloween, but was added in as a normal ship before it could become one.\

== Description ==\
The '''Vansnova''' is a PVP ship with an energy orb in front. Its firepower comes from its energy orb that is armed with 5 Large Cannons and 5 Large Phasers. It is a Spinal-only [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Vansnova''' has no interior, you just go through the cockpit.\
== Advantages ==\
* High health combined with excellent maneuverability.\
* Powerful spinals.\
* Can outgun most [[ships]] of its class effectively.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No [[Turrets]].\
* Low HP.\
* Can be easily defeated by other Battlecruisers if the enemy pilot is skilled enough.\
* Only able to shoot from the front of the ship, so if other ships attack from the top, bottom, left, right, or back, the ship is undefended.\
== Strategy ==\
* Aim the [[Spinals]] where the enemy is going to be and try to get in blind spots.\
* Always move in some random directions, as to make it harder for Spinal shots and Turret fire to hit your agile form.\
* If you have a pack of these, then you'll be able to swarm and kill most ships that dare challenge you.\
* Due to its high mobility, it can easily cover its blind spots.\
* Try to drift as much as you can so that you're always going at top speed but never going too close or too far from your target.\
== Version History ==\
* 9 Tiny Phasers buffed to 9 Small Phasers in .64d.\
* Remodeled in .66b\
* Phasers reduced from 9 barrels to 6, interval increased by 0.2 seconds in version .66b.\
* Phasers increased from 6 barrels to 8, interval decreased to \"burst\" in version .68e.\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Vansnova''' was based on Tempest from Starcraft 2, Heart of the Swarm.\
* The '''Vansnova's''' original name was the Visebalerioth.\
* The '''Vansnova''' has an Easter egg decal of the \"One Piece\" Anime at the Control Panel. It used to have another easter egg, which was the \"rcouret, pls notice me\" message but it later was removed for currently unknown reasons.\
* Prior to version .69d1, this ship was one of the 4 Battlecruisers that does not require a gamepass to use in [[Galaxy Arcade]].\
* The newest model is based on a fighter spawned on the [[Executioner]], the [[Hunter]].\
* 4th highest DPS out of all non-event battlecruisers.\

It is armed with four [[Spinal Weaponry|Medium Torpedoes]], which are unique in appearance and also unique to the ship. Unlike most other [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ships, it was built in the regular '''Frigate''' build menu.\
==Interior==\
The '''Blue Torp Wasp''' has no interior. The exterior is simply a reskinned wasp.\
==Advantages==\
*Carries two small [[Spinals|Torpedoes]] that do around 250 damage per volley.\
*Very small, making it difficult for [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]] to hit it.\
*Cheap, costing 600 [[Credits]] total. Even most newbies could afford it.\
*Extremely fast turn speed.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Low [[hull|health]] makes it easy to kill.\
*Was only available for 24 hours, just like the [[Festive Wasp]], [[Coal Wasp]], and [[Disruptor]] (although the Disruptor was released again).\
*Was a Hidden event, Since there was a 24-hour time span in which most Public servers didn't get the update and never received this. You would have needed a private server to receive this.\
==Strategy==\

*Has custom Torpedoes.\
*Has its own cult dedicated to it.\
*The [[Wasp]] has been \"remodeled\", but the '''Blue Torp Wasp''' still has the old model of it. The only differences between the old Wasp and the '''Blue Torp Wasp''' are the Tiny layers on the back and the black part.\
*Just one of the 4 versions of the wasp to ever come out. \
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a E class permit (310k credits) + 60 Sillicate, 30 Carbon, 21 Iridium, 15 Adamantite, 14 Palladium, 13 Titanium, 13 Quantium, and 9 Uranium\

==Description==\
The '''Khapri''' is an Avellian Dreadnought from the 2021 Christmas Event. It was obtained in a similar fashion to the [[Shadowmane]] and [[Mantid]] in that you would jump up inside the fireplace at the [[Mega Base]] and find the gift box that rewards this ship from the quest. Its turret armament is completely focused on shield damage, while its spinals are focused on hull damage. It also shares a very similar look to the [[Halkaryak]].\
==Interior==\
There is practically no interior, it's just a pilot seat slapped on a small baseplate inside the ship.\
==Advantages==\
*Considerable health for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], with a total health pool of 13,900 hit points.\
*Vertical profile combined with speed can make this ship rather difficult for inaccurate turrets to hit.\
*Decent armament allows you to fight most normal Dreadnoughts and still stay on top of the fight.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Can be awkward to aim the spinals due to the ship's handling and profile.\
*Large size and profile from the side can make it easy for enemies to hit your ship.\
*Very expensive snowflake cost(175,000 credit worth).\
*An overall expensive ship.\
*Somewhat sluggish turning.\
*[[:Category:Limited|Limited]] classification means you will be targeted often.\
==Strategy==\
*While you could use this ship for tanking, that isn't a good idea to do with most [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ships. Instead, use this ship as a support in sieges.\
*Only use this ship if you are sure you will not lose it.\
*Don't try to engage with agile or small ships, your turrets will miss and you will struggle to accurately hit your spinals.\
*If you engage in combat with another capital ship, use your health and speed to your advantage.\
==Version History==\
*Interior teleporter fixed in version .75a1.\
*Buffed in version .75a5, Gained 1 Huge Cannon, [[Turrets|Avellian Eliminators]] gained more DPS.\
*Explosion Size 250 ----> 870 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*The first person to lose this ship was useless_money to an [[:Category:Alien|Alien]] [[Avellian Stronghold]] nuke.\

== Description ==\
The '''Corvid''' is a powerful Destroyer with good firepower and health. The '''Corvid''' boasts 5 Light Railguns and 1 Medium Railgun on the belly of the ship, and 2 Tiny Cannons on the sides. It has great speed and moderate health, but due to its price, it isn't the best starting warship for new players. It is a really good option for when you can afford it though.\
== Appearance ==\
The entrance in the back leads to short hallway, eventually ending at the pilot's seat. There are also rooms to the left and right with a kitchen/sleeping area and fire extinguisher. In the middle of the hallway are some stairs that lead to a bottom floor with a 2nd exit below the docking point.\
== Advantages ==\
* Good Price.\
* Great for chipping away at larger ships such as battlecruisers or battleships.\
* It's great agility makes up for it's bulk.\
* Great [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
* Balanced [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] stats.\
*Great Hull damage.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Large body makes it an easy target for more inaccurate weaponry when not using it's speed to your advantage.\
*Mediocre shield damage.\
*Expensive compared to other options.\
*Low Shield Damage.\
== Strategy==\
* Use the '''Corvid''' to chip away at Capital Ships.\
*Keep a distance of about 5k - 6k ''above'' the enemy ship, and bombard the enemy with your 6 railgun. \
*Use paired with capital ships.\
*In a fleet, help your teammates finish off hulled ships.\
*If you are a lower score, this ship may be a bit expensive for you, so warp away when you are hulled. Because of your balanced shield / hull ratio, your hull should be able to resist the damage while you charge your warp.\
== Version History ==\
* The '''Corvid''' got a buff with extra Turrets and a lower cost in an unknown version.\
* 2 Light Flak Cannons got changed to 2 Light Gatling Cannons in version .62_dbg03.\
* Remodeled in version .66k?\
*A Light Gatling Laser replaced a Light Railgun on the side of the ship in version .75a5\
== Trivia ==\
* Once considered useless, the ship is now more viable in [[:Category:PVP Ship|PVP]] than it was before the buff.\
* Used to be the cheapest Destroyer upon release.\
* Held on to its alpha model longer than most ships.\
*It has two entrances, one on the top which is the one used to dock, and one on the bottom. Both are on the back.\

==Description==\
The '''''A - Brawler''''' is a small, powerful, [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]-like fighter that is spawned on the [[Annihilator]] which is based off of the [[Brawler]].\
==Appearance==\
The A-Brawler has an identical appearance to the battleship [[Brawler]]. \
\
The '''<u>Interior</u>''' is a simple black box with a black seat on the front, there is no exit teleporter once you get inside, making you trapped inside unless you reset.\
==Advantages==\
* Very powerful for a fighter, has stats akin to a battleship and more DPS than most battleships\
*Very high health for a Fighter-class ship.\
*Good amount of [[Turrets]] for a fighter, with a decent 7.\
*Can provide as much support as most [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*As with all Kneall based ships, the turrets are rather inaccurate.\
*Easy to hit and destroy due to the sluggish mobility, and complete lack of damage resistance.\
* Like with all other fighters, no warp drive.\
==Strategy ==\
*Use this monster of a fighter like a sacrificial battleship.\
* Get a skilled player inside the Brawler, as AI Fighters shoot spinals inconsistently and turn their backs sometimes, losing half of its firepower.\
*Avoid going head-to-head against a dreadnought or higher class ship if you aren't planning to sacrifice yourself yet.\
==Version History ==\
*Added in version .75a10\
* Health nerfed to 300/300 until the duration of the ongoing [[Kneall Event]]\
*Name changed A - Bioicle -> A - Brawler .75a37\
==Trivia ==\
*Once you enter the fighter, you cannot get out unless you reset because there's no exit teleporter inside the ship.\
*Almost identical to the [[Brawler]].\
* Lower health, fighter class instead of battleship class and slightly lower spinal DPS than [[Kneall Brawler]]. Otherwise identical.\
*One of the strongest fighters in the game, tied with the [[Elanis]], which is also a Battleship-like fighter and also one of the only 2 [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]-like fighters in the game.\

==Description==\
The '''Scout''' is the [[Aliens|Alien]] equivalent of a [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]]/[[:Category:Fighters|Fighters|Fighter]] and is well known for annoying [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]]. It is mostly black with large neon areas and has a bottom-mounted and top-mounted [[Turrets]].\
==Behavior==\
'''Scouts''' will attempt to stay around 3 to 4.5K studs away from whatever they are attacking and may move below [[Ships]] to maintain their turret's line of sight. When attacking a slow or stationary target, they are often seen moving back and forth in mostly straight lines. They have a tendency to go underneath Ships to make it hard for main [[Turrets]] to hit.\
\
'''Scouts''' will always answer a call from an [[Punisher|Alien Punisher]] or Alien/Kneall Boss when it is attacking any player or Starbase. Hordes of '''Scouts''' can easily overwhelm players and starbases, even if said player has a battleship or dreadnaught, they are know to cause serious damage. When the Punisher they are called to is destroyed, '''Swarmers''' will either start to scatter, go to another nearby Punisher (if there is one), continue to attack the Punisher's target, or drift slowly away from the location.\
\
Scoutsare more likely to attack [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]], so stay alert.\
==Strategy==\
Due to their significant dps and high top speed, '''Scouts''' are best attacked using ships with high-accuracy [[Turrets]]. Light and Medium-sized [[Turrets]], aside from Railguns, best fit these guidelines.\
==Loot==\
'''Scouts''' drop 3 Snowflakes and 25 alien parts.\
\
== Trivia ==\
*After decoding the description, it reveals to say \"From beyond light comes the blessing of decay\"\
* Has a Laughable Explosion value of 8\
* The '''Swarmer '''has no trail.\
* If the player that is attacking them [[Warp Drive|Warps]] away, they will likely not follow and will go away, or if in a fleet, scatter.\
* Scouts are often seen as nuisances more than threats to many players (although can still be dangerous in fleets or against low-health [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
* Unlike the Swarmer, Shadowstrike and Cranefly, there is no limit to how many can be spawned in a server at any time. However, the alien spawn limit of 20 still applies.\
* Received a nerf in the spawn rate, due to them spawning too quickly and overwhelming entire servers.\

== Description ==\
The '''Worm''' is a [[Wyrm]]-sized [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] with two [[Spinals]] and a Light Cannon, as well as a Wyrm-sized Cargo Hold. Its in-game description explains that it was specially designed for smugglers, [[Pirating|Pirates]], and scavengers.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Worm''' has a small cockpit similar on the outside to the Wyrm. The pilot's seat is always the color of the player's faction. In front of this seat are a red screen and two joystick-like controls, similar to the layout of the [[Archangel]].\
== Advantages ==\
* High top speed.\
* Has both a Cannon and Phaser, making it balanced in terms of [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower.\
* The highest Cargo Hold of any build menu Frigate.\
* One of the cheapest [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]].\
* Has higher [[Shields]] than the Wyrm, and a total of 10 more health points overall.\
* Good for hunting down stray [[aliens]] and taking the loot to sell at the [[Mega Base]]\
== Disadvantages  ==\
* Low health.\
* Spinals deal little damage.\
* It has less hull health than the Wyrm.\
* Its [[Turrets|Turret]] won't do much damage at all, even if a ship is on [[Hull]].\
* Unlike the Wyrm, it cannot see wrecks from far away.\
* Vulnerable underside.\
* Terrible acceleration, being three times slower than the giant [[E Class]].\
== Strategy ==\
* Never target ships such as the [[Ampharos]], since they can destroy you easily.\
* Use the '''Worm''' like a Wyrm but with a little bit of defense.\
* Fly in groups to maximize firepower.\
* When attacking [[:Category:Miner|Miners]], you don't have to worry about losing your ship because of how cheap it is.\
* Use this ship for Pirating.\
* Don't forget that if you shoot another ship before docking at Mega Base, you will be in hostile mode.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a remodel in .65b\
* Cargo Hold nerfed from 250 to 100 in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
*Has a similar appearance to the [[Wyrm]].\
*The '''Worm'''’s control sticks have a remarkable resemblance to those on the current [[Archangel]].\
*Even though the ship's description claims it was made by putting armor on a [[Wyrm]], the '''Worm''' has less hull health than the Wyrm.\

The '''Gunslinger''' is a low-cost ship, good at supporting in attacking bases and defending against other ships as the Cannons deal massive damage. It comes at a cost though, as it is slow and not as maneuverable as most other [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]].\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Gunslinger''' is sparsely decorated. It only has a small pilot's seat in front with a few team-colored parts near it.\
== Advantages ==\
* Decent durability.\
* Relatively low cost.\
* Wreaks havoc on [[hull]] and anything you can hit with your [[Spinals]].\
* Decent health for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].\
* Cheap.\
* Amazing swarm ship.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Comparatively low [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
* Low damage against shield.\

* Make maximum use of the spinal weapons which can do tons of damage if hitting a target.\
* A good choice for a beginner to help out in a siege.\
* Stay in a group of stronger ships and always be behind them when sieging so you won't take damage.\
* Defend your base by aiming at the bigger ships with your [[Spinals]].\
== Version History ==\
* <span>It received a minor remake to the model as well as the addition of 2 [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannons]] in around versions .47 - .48.</span>\
* Spinal barrel interval decreased from 0.5s to 0.1s in version .66b.\

* Vulnerable when using this ship alone.\
* [[Pirating|Pirates]] consider this ship their ultimate target even if it's fast, defensive and has more health since this ship is '''very rare''' to see.\

* Light Laser removed in version .65b.\
* Ore Hold increased from 1800 to 4500 later in version .65b.\
*Shields and Hull increased from 1,500/1,750 to 2,000/2,000 in version .75a10.\

The '''Zhanado''' is a [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] that has a very high firepower and health. It is slower than most other Frigates. The '''Zhanado''' has spikes protruding from the front of the ship near it's 4 Tiny Cannons and 4 Tiny Phasers.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Zhanado''' is a cockpit with a chair, in which features a joystick and throttle. There is a Chaotic Unity logo, along with some buttons and some screens.\
== Advantages ==\
* High damaging [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]].\
* Great against large ships with big blind spots, such as the [[Ridgebreaker]] and the [[Avalon]].\
* Very cheap.\
* Fast reload speed.\
* Good health for a Frigate.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Slow for a Frigate.\
* You must be capable of aiming [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] well to deal considerable damage.\
== Strategy ==\
* You can be very daring with this ship because it is extremely cheap.\
* Use large ships' blind spots and constantly use your Spinals to maximize damage.\
* While it is still a relatively slow Frigate, utilize your small figure to dogfight with larger ships.\
* Great when used in a swarm due to its fairly high Spinal damage.\
== Version History ==\
* Price and ore requirement was increased from original price-point.\
* Received remodel in update right after the Capital Cannons update part 1, but no official update name was given. The remodel also removed the VIP requirement.\
* Spinals fixed in version .66n\
* Remodeled in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* Not commonly seen.\
* Based on a Fighter concept from Star Citizen.\
* As of this moment in version .66 the laser spinal shoots to the right side of the ship instead of straight ahead. (Patched)\
* Old model looks extremely similar to the current [[Abyss]] model.\

== Description ==\
The '''Aura''' is a Cruiser focused somewhat on spinal weaponry and hull health. This ship has two arms mounted in a beetle horn-like configuration around the front-mounted cockpit. The ship's two turrets lie behind these arms on the main body, providing limited line-of-sight against ships directly in front of or below the '''Aura'''; this is somewhat mitigated by the need to aim the ship to properly use its spinals.\
== Appearance ==\
The Interior contains a very advanced layout of computers and navigation systems, it is very similar to advanced ships like the Zhen. It has a very decorated path from the teleporter outside the ship to the inside.\
== Advantages ==\
* Outstanding amount of damage output from [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]], focusing on [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
* Very cheap.\
* Spinal reload is very fast.\
* Has decent range.\
* Possibly the best ship to start learning on how to use [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] weapons.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* While it has a good amount of hull, the Aura lacks shields which makes it vulnerable to hull breakers.\
* It's turn speed and maximum speed are not impressive for its class, and it can be out-maneuvered by faster ships.\
* Low amount of overall damage from turrets.\
* Weak against most larger ships.\
== Strategy ==\
* Outputs high overall damage through its spinals (100 Shield DPS and 70 Hull DPS).\
* Try to get beneath the enemy or get in its blindspot to deal a lot of damage.\
* Due to the slow turning speed, it's suggested to stay at distance when targeting enemies.\
* Try to stay in a group when engaging larger targets.\
* Always tail other spinal ships if possible, as they lack the power to take you down in a short amount of time.\
== Version History ==\
* Introduced in .66b.\
* Spinal configuration and barrel count fixed.\
* Turnspeed decreased to 0.35 (from 0.4) and Maxspeed decreased to 110 (from 125) during the '''Black Friday 2019'''.\
* 2 [[Spinals|Tiny Phasers]] removed and 6 [[Spinals|Tiny Cannons]] changed to 4 Small Cannons in version .69a2.\
* Disabled in an unknown version (before [[Halloween Event 2020]]) for a very very, small amount of time along with every other ship that starts with the letter A.\

* Work with other [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to quickly destroy other [[ships]] and drain health quickly.\
* The spinals have a higher range than most ships and bases. Utilize this to your advantage.\
*A small siege fleet or support can be formed with your other Wraiths as each fighter has 2 Small Torpedoes, which can outrange [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]].\
*Focus on swarming and destroying [[Galaxy Slang|AA]] ships like the [[Ampharos]] or [[Hyron]] first, as they will shred you if left alone.\

== Description ==\
The''' Grim''' is a [[Ships|Battleship]] that was added during the[[Halloween Event 2018|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Halloween Event (2018)</span>]]. Players had to complete the quest [[Death Incarnate]] to obtain it. The '''Grim''' is armed with 4 Grim Railguns.\
== Interior ==\
A teleporter just on the outside leads you straight to the cockpit. The pilot's seat is inside the orb.\
== Advantages ==\
* It is one of the fastest ships in its class.\
* Its health pool is higher than all [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], and even some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], too.\
* Insanely powerful [[Spinals]].\
* Extremely high DPS for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Easily swarmed by small ships if the pilot is not skilled enough.\
* Pirates and other fleets may target this ship as a trophy kill.\
*Must be good at aiming spinals since it makes up the majority of the DPS.\
*The most expensive battleship in the game (but only because of the Class B Permit).\
== Version History ==\
* 4 Skull Turrets replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Advanced Medium Autocannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Advanced Medium Autolasers]] in an unknown version.\
* [[Hull]] reduced from 6666 to 3333, 8 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] changed to 8 [[Spinals|Large Phasers]] and 4 [[Spinals|Large Cannons]] changed to 4 [[Spinals|Huge Cannons]] in version .68d.\
* Added to the limited build menu in version .73a?, requiring a Class B Permit and regular materials.\
* 2 Medium Advanced Autocannons and 2 Medium Advanced Autolasers replaced with 4 Grim Railguns in version .73b8.\
*Explosion size 120 ----> 600 .75a12\
== Strategy ==\
* Best used as a support ship in sieges, or as a finisher ship on lighter targets.\
* Great against other [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and some [[:Category:dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] since it can outmaneuver them while inflicting high Spinal damage.\
* Always bring a fleet to cover your ship as it is a high priority target due to its value and rarity.\
== Trivia ==\
* Due to duplication glitches (and other issues never fully revealed), the quest to obtain the '''Grim''' was taken down before the [[Halloween Event 2018]] ended.\
* The first person to build a '''Grim''' was HK4l7.\

==Description==\
The '''''Halkaryak''''' is the first carrier in the game to be vertical. It shares a similar model to the [[Slipstream]], [[Ampharos]] and [[Mjolnheimr]]. It shares design traits with the [[Revenant]].\
==Interior==\
The interior for both bridge and fighter bays are very basic: \
* '''Bridge:''' A brown box that consists of a pilot seat, a teleporter, and a wall of text that mocks the nature of the lazily made interior.\
\
* '''Fighter bays:''' Three narrow brown boxes that contain one [[Sin]] each, with a dynamic rippling forcefield in front of the fighter. The boxes are so small that the player barely has room to jump when the [[Sin]] is inside.\
==Advantages==\
* High overall health.\
*Very high damage-per-second to shield.\
* Fast considering its size and class.\
* One of the highest turret damage-per-second stats of all carriers.\
* Sins have somewhat high and balanced health.\
*Very slim, making it hard to hit.\
*Sins have extremely high individual damage-per-second against hull, having a volley of 24 Small Cannons each.\
*No blind spots.\
*Pairs well with the fighters, as the ship does high shield damage, while the fighters do high hull damage.\
*Relatively cheap to equip all fighters with AI fighters, only costing 750 robux without VIP.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Fighters mostly deal hull damage, making them weak against shield-based ships unless used together with the carrier, and vice-versa.\
* Low fighter count, only having 3 [[Sin]]s.\
* Low Cargo Hold for its class.\
*Very expensive.\
*Inaccurate turrets\
\
*Will be hunted due to it being a limited ship.\
==Strategy==\
* Use this ship in fleets, not only due to its lack of hull damage, but also because this expensive carrier is a huge target for pirates.\
*Focus fire on larger ships so all of your turrets can hit, decimating enemy shields.\
*Use your slim width and speed to strafe shots coming towards you.\
*Pair up with hull-shredding ships such as the [[Ridgebreaker]] to become the perfect ship-destroying duo.\
==Version History==\
* No logged changes.\
==Trivia==\
* Vaguely looks like the <s>Naglfar</s> Tornado from EVE Online.\
*Is called a '''<nowiki>''Bow''</nowiki>''' by most players.\
**Many people find this ship incredibly ugly.\

* Has to be in a certain angle to let all turrets hit with spinals being able to hit as well.\
*Relies on the phasers to deal shield damage.\
==Version History==\
* Received a buff in version .73d6, turret loadout changed from 1 Light Laser and 4 Bone Lurkers to 9 Bone Lurkers, spinals changed from 4 Large Phasers to 12 Tiny Phasers and 1 Large Torpedo, Top Speed increased from 60 to 150, Turn Speed increased from 0.6 to 0.7, and Shields/Hull changed from 5000/4000 to 4500/4250.\
* Received a nerf in an unknown version, spinals changed from 12 Tiny Phasers and 1 Large Torpedo to 6 Tiny Phasers and 1 Large Torpedo.\
*Explosion size 100 ----> 520 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*It is a reskin of the [[Scourge]] but it is player-made.\
*The only battleship released in part 2 of the Halloween event.\
*The first person to lose a Naga was ghastroo406 by abc123austinp\

==Advantages==\
* Extremely powerful spinals, equal to the [[Zhen]] and high DPS for a fighter, with a DPS of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.spinal_dps|where=ShipData._pageName = 'IceFyre'}}\
* Extremely fast and agile for a fighter with a top speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.top_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = 'IceFyre'}} and a turn speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turn_speed |where=ShipData._pageName = 'IceFyre'}}.\
* Can engage [[Starbase]]s at an extremely long range of 10000 Studs thanks to its 1 Medium Torpedo.\
* Can drift at high speeds because of the 90% [[Strategies#Drifting|Drift Percentage]] for Fighter-class ships.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Non-existent Damage Resistance of 0%\
* Can be easily destroyed by [[Galaxy Slang|AA]] Ships.\
==Strategy==\
* This [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] is best used in a swarm. Attack the enemy with high speed and with its high shield damage, a swarm will bring enemy ships to [[Hull]] quickly, then try to finish it off with its Medium Torpedoes.\
* Can provide useful siege support due to it carrying a Medium Torpedo.\
* Utilize drifting and hit-and-run tactic to survive as long as possible while dealing the maximum amount of damage.\
* Use the ship's high maneuverability to get into the blind spots of larger ships and deal heavy spinal damage.\
==Version History==\
* 6 Small Phasers upsized to 6 Medium Phasers in an unknown version (only revealed in-game).\
*Acceleration reduced from 70 to 50 in an unknown version (only revealed in-game).\

== Description ==\
The '''Invictus''' is armed with [[Turrets|Five Light Lasers]] and 2 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]]. It has a total health pool of 2600, rivaling [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] in health. The '''Invictus''' has slow acceleration.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior is simple, being composed of only the pilot seat that has a joystick and a single passenger seat behind it.\
== Advantages ==\
* Highest health of all [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]].\
* Great against [[Shields]] and shield breakers.\
* No blind spots.\
* Large cargo hold for a Cruiser.\
* Great for support.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Slow acceleration for a Cruiser.\
* Expensive for a Cruiser despite needing only a level 1 [[Warehouse]].\
* Has no kinetic weaponry, making it hard to damage Hull.\
* Cannot focus all Turrets on a target at once unless facing directly away/towards the target.\
* Weak shields compared to Hull, and very weak to hull breakers.\
== Strategy ==\
* Excellent choice if you want to hunt down the [[Cobra]] since it has high Hull, speed, and anti-shield firepower.\
* Use as support for ships that lack [[Shields|Shield-damaging]] firepower.\
* In PVP, always make sure you are exploiting the enemy's blind spot.\
* Try this when [[sieging]] a level 1 [[Starbase]] since its high Hull won't suffer under the intense laser fire. Once the base is hulled, switch this ship out for a hull-breaker.\
* Great for harassing the [[Lazarus]], a [[Ships|ship]] with high Shields and low Hull.\
*A swarm of these could be used as a perfect counter to the [[Zeus]], since they are good ad breaking shields and being sturdy against shield breakers.\
==Version History==\
* Max Hull increased from 1300 to 2000 in version .65b\
* Was remodeled in version .66b\
== Trivia ==\
* Looks inspired off of a fighter jet.\
* The old model was reskinned as the [[Icy|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Icy</span>]] during the [[Christmas Event 2017|Christmas 2017 Event.]]\

== Description ==\
The '''Nixesion''' is a very powerful fighter that spawns only in the [[Nyx]], with good health and high DPS in swarms at the cost of slow maneuverability.\
== Appearance ==\
Like all fighter class ships, the '''Nixesion''' has little in the way of an interior.\
== Advantages ==\
* Very high firepower for a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]]. (Higher than most destroyers and cruisers).\
* Decent durability.\
* Has two weapon types, allowing it to be effective no matter the situation.\
* Easy to control since it moves slow enough for the pilot to react.\
* A couple of '''Nixesions''' can destroy a Level 1, 2 and even a level 3 or 4 [[Starbase]] if undefended.\
* Effective when used to swarm large [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], and [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]].\
* Just 2-3 can deal more damage than most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]\
== Disadvantages  ==\
* Slow for a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]].\
* Can be shot down easily by Light Turrets.\
* Can be out-ranged.\
* No [[Turrets]].\
== Strategy ==\
* Listen to the captain of the Carrier. If you are told to focus on one ship or base, try to get every fighter to target it so as to maximize damage.\
* Ask for teammates to pilot the '''Nixesions'''.\
* Fighters are free. You can die as many times as you need to get the job done, but the enemy can't. Keep swarming until you win, and wear the enemy down.\
* Fly together in large swarms.\
* Fly at full speed to help avoid being shot down\
* Focus on destroying ships like the [[Ampharos]] first. Anything with a high count of light Turrets will easily rip apart '''Nixesions''' due to their slower speed, and '''Nixesions''' lack warp drives to escape. The best thing you can do is attempt to destroy threats like this as quickly as possible.\
* Overpower the enemy with swarms of '''Nixesions'''. Even a tempest can't fight back if enough fighters attack it.\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled in an unknown version.\
* Received a remodel in version .66m, spinal count buffed from 3/4 to 4/6 along with 70 extra hull health.\
* Phaser size decreased from small to tiny in version .75a5\
* Phase count reduced to 4 as of 2/7/2022\
== Trivia ==\
* Two of these Fighters are featured on the main thumbnail for Galaxy.\
* Renamed from Nyxesion to '''Nixesion''' due to a bug of using the cost command where it would show the '''Nixesion's''' price instead of the [[Nyx|Nyx's]].\
* It's new model vaguely resembles a dragon.\

<div class=\"cardcontainer\" style=\"font-size:15px; line-height:24px\">\
The '''2020 Halloween Event''' started on October 15<sup>th</sup> and ran until November 22<sup>nd</sup>. Marked as version .69b1, Part 1 of the update added 4 new ships, a Halloween themed Mega Base model, the [[Necromancer]] boss, [[Alien Serv]]s, [[Alien Scourge]]s, [[Gamma Pumpkin|Gamma Pumpkins]] and other hidden changes. Part 2 added [[The Rift]] and 2 new mini-bosses, [[Rift Guardian|Rift Guardians]] and Rift Custodians, as well as 4 new quest ships. Part 3 added 2 more new quest ships, the [[Blackgate]] and [[Incarnate]].  \
\
There were 10 ships that were available during the event. All of the ships required Gamma Pumpkins to create them. However, only 4 of the 10 ships that include the [[Vampire X-R4|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Vampire X-R4</span>]], [[Dullahan|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Dullahan</span>]] ([[Banshee]] recolor), [[Jack-Al'-Lantern|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Jack-Al'-Lantern</span>]] ([[Jackal]] recolor) and [[Jupiter|<span style=\"color:#ff7500\">Jupiter</span>]] ([[Zeus]] recolor) could be acquired in the ship building menu. The remaining 6 ships, the [[Black Scarab]], [[Naga]] ([[Alien Scourge]]), [[Acolyte]], [[Revenge]], [[Incarnate]], and the [[Blackgate]] were hard to acquire and could only be created through quests found inside the Rift, and required Void Pumpkins that were dropped by the Rift Guardians and Rift Custodians.\

== Description ==\
The '''Radiance''' is a long ship with a barrel on the front and engines on the back. The whole front of the ship is taken up by the [[Spinals|Large Cannon]], with ridges on either side. The four [[Turrets|Lasers]] are mounted on the top, bottom, and sides of the center area of the ship.\
== Appearance ==\
Once you go through the main entrance (in the back of the ship) you will see a long hallway with two or three different rooms. The end of the hallway opens to a small room from which the pilot controls the ship.\
== Advantages ==\
*Turret placement leaves it with no blind spots.\
*Laser and Phaser arsenal burns down [[shields]].\
* Great as an escort.\
* Very effective against pirating ships.\
*Good maneuverability.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Lacks anti-Hull weaponry, making it ineffective against hulled ships.\
* Lacks long-range weaponry; can only effectively attack anything within 4000 studs or less.\
* Cannot focus all Turrets on 1 target unless they are directly ahead.\
* Slightly lower health than other [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]].\
== Strategy ==\
* Decent for ship-to-ship combat, provided backup is available or it can tank long enough to make up for its lacking Hull damage.\
* Great for dealing with medium-sized, high-shield [[ships]], such as the [[Zero]], [[Sixfold]], or [[Cobra]].\
* Similar in weaponry to the [[Dire Wolf]], the '''Radiance''' is more optimized for dealing with smaller ships, while the Dire Wolf can fight better against larger ships.\
* This ship pairs well with the [[Razor Wing]] as it shreds shield while the Razor Wing is a [[hull]] destroyer.\
== Version History ==\
* 4 Light Lasers replaced with 2 Medium Lasers in .64d. Also gained 300 more shield health.\
* Received a remodel in version .66n.\
== Trivia ==\
*Some may see this as an old ship.\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Falcon''' was a unique [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter-Class]] ship resembling its namesake that can spawn only in [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier-class]] ships. It is a relatively normal [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] in speed and size, and is currently the 4th fastest behind [[Xenophile]], [[Nighthawk]], and [[Dragonfly]]. The '''Falcon''' only has three tiny [[Spinals|Phasers]], which is made up for by a very quick reload speed. Furthermore, the '''Falcon'''<nowiki/>'s low firepower is compensated by ''very'' high health for a [[:Category:Fighters|fighter-class]] ship, even more than some [[:category: frigate|Frigate-class]] ships.\
== Appearance ==\
Like all [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter-class]] [[Ships]], the '''Falcon''' has little in the way of an interior.\
== Advantages ==\
* Fast.\
* Maneuverable.\
* One of the tankiest fighters in game, beaten out by the [[Harbinger]] and [[Elanis]] as well as the [[Sakala]]s old [[Sanguine]] Fighters, and tied with the [[Interceptor]].\
* The three tiny phasers reload very fast, allowing it to fire rapidly.\
* Higher health than some [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyers]] and [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Little firepower, with only three tiny Phasers.\
* Susceptible to light [[Turrets]].\
* Only two of them spawned in their signature carrier, the [[Vanguard]].\
* Because it only spawned in the [[Vanguard]], it requires at least one [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] person due to the Vanguard being a VIP ship.\
== Strategy ==\
* Like any [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]], hide in a ship's blind spots.\
* Try to work together with multiple [[:Category:Fighters|fighters]] to make up for the low firepower and to distract [[turrets]].\
* Be especially careful fighting ships like an [[Ampharos]], as it and others have many high-accuracy [[Turrets]] that can easily destroy even this high-health [[:Category:Fighters|fighter]].\
* Rotate the ship a lot to lower your chance of getting hit.\
* Slow down a bit when fighting smaller enemies.\
* Get inside a starbase by going into a docking port and start to eat up the base's health. (caution: possible ban)\
== Version History ==\
*Tiny Phaser spinal count increased from 1 to 3 in version .72f1.\
*Removed from the [[Vanguard]] and replaced with Y.Falcons in version .74b14.\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Falcon''' was designed specifically for the [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]]-only [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier-Class]] ship, the [[Vanguard]].\
*Currently so part-shifted its almost impossible to get in the pilot seat.\
* The '''Falcon''' is actually small enough to fit in a [[Starbase]]'s docking ports.\
*Not fly-able in-game anymore since they were removed from the vanguard/\

"How_To_Play_Galaxy","<div class=\"cardcontainer\">{{Outdated}}<h1>How To Play Galaxy</h1>\
Getting started is easy! You are going to need to make some credits and gather materials to build some awesome new warships, freighters, and miners. You start with a small mining ship called the [[Wasp]] and a small freighter, the [[Wyrm]]. Stand near the center of a [[Starbase]] and click on the OPEN MENU button that appears near the bottom of your screen. \
\
Next, click on 'Ship Menu' then, 'Spawn Ship', and select your [[Wasp]]. It will now dock at one of the many terminals in your [[Starbase]]. Take note which terminal it is arriving at and head that way (A message will appear in chat telling you which terminal your ship is docking at). When you have reached the correct terminal and see your [[Wasp]], sit in the pilot seat. You can click anywhere on your screen to change the direction of your ship.\
\
You can use the W key to start moving forward and also take note of the control keys at the bottom left of your screen. Look for a nearby asteroid ([[Ores]]) and fly there, leaving at most 4500 studs in between your ship and the [[Ores]]. Then, when you are close enough, click on the \"Bottom Mining Laser\" button, or press the number corresponding to it on your keyboard (used to quickly choose the Mining Lasers, as well as other [[Turrets]]), which you can find at the bottom of the screen, and select the square that highlights the [[Ores]]. Your Mining Laser will automatically start mining.\
\
Once you have a full Ore Hold, return to your [[Starbase]]. Dock and walk into the [[Starbase]], click on the OPEN MENU button like before and click the DUMP ORE button (gives you the Starbase's credits). Two options should pop up, both self-explanatory (for more detailed information on [[Mining]], read the [[Mining]] page).\
\
Once you get a decent amount of credits, you can start building new ships. Select the \"Build Ship\" menu at any base (preferably the [[Mega Base]]), select which ship you would like to build, note how much materials you will need, the cost of the ship and the [[Warehouse]] level of the ship. You can use the [[Commands|:cost command]] or the [[Commands|:info command]] to help you.\
\
To get the materials needed you can either buy the [[Ores|Refined Ore]] from your [[Starbase]], use a [[Wyrm]] to fly to the [[Mega Base]], and transfer into your [[Warehouse]], or buy the [[Ores|Refined Ores]] from the [[Mega Base]] that others have once sold there (usually the cheaper option). Once you have all the materials and the right amount of credits, you can click 'Build Ship' and it will then give you the ship.\
\
Some ships can be only obtained from [[Quests]] or the [[Advanced Ship Computers]]. For more information on them, visit their pages.\
\
If you still don't know what you are doing, you can watch some of the YouTube tutorials included below.\

The '''Viper''' is the second fastest [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] in the game. This ship is good for distracting [[Starbase]] [[Turrets]]. It is also one of the few ships to be almost completely white in color, aside from one main faction-colored stripe in the middle.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Viper''' has a simple interior, with only a pilot's seat, a small black and grey cylinder without a known use, and a tiny screen showing a gyroscope-like readout.\
== Advantages ==\
* Extremely high mobility, one of the highest in the game if you don't consider [[:Category:Admin|Admin]] ships or the [[Coal Wasp]].\
* High shield firepower for a [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]].\
* One of the best choices for a distraction while sieging and can be used to change the tide of war.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No [[Turrets]].\
* Low hull and shields.\
* Weak against hull.\
* One of the most expensive Frigates in the game at this current state.\
* The change in the way bases target ships has caused the '''Viper''' to be useless for distracting bases.\
== Strategy ==\
* It is very good for attacking [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] from below and dodging all return fire.\
* It is an excellent choice whenever speed and small size are key.\
* Great at attacking siege ships when defending your base.\
* If you go to the height limit of the map and warp to an enemy base, you can give some support fire to a siege.\
* A good choice for scouting bases before an attack by outrunning base [[Turrets]].\
* The heaviest of armies will fail to outrun you at top speed.\
* Abuse your size in retreat situations.\
== Trivia ==\
* It is a replica of the ''Viper'' Mark II from \"Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome.\
* It is a popular ship for newer players.\
* rcouret's favorite ship.\
* Has two event reskins, the [[Patriotic Viper]] and the [[Golden Viper]].\
* Used to be the second fastest ship in the game at a maximum 330 speed, just behind the [[Dragonfly|Dragonfly's]] 380; however, as of update .66b, it is now slower than the [[Draco]] and many fighters.\
* Used to be one of the most popular ships to distract Starbase's.\
* Often used to lure bosses to friendly bases due to its speed.\

== Description ==\
The '''Jack-Al'-Lantern''' is a recolor of the [[Jackal]]. The primary change is that it was recolored to be orange. Its Hull, Top Speed, Turn Speed and [[Spinals]] are buffed compared to the regular Jackal, while its Shield is slightly lower, but otherwise it does not differ significantly from its counterpart.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Jack-Al'-Lantern''' is identical to its counterpart, except that the statues lining the main walkway are replaced with skulls. The Hyperion core is encased in a pumpkin shaped shell. The pilots main cockpit has a green light when docked. However, when in motion the green light flickers creating a lightning effect.\
== Advantages ==\
* Powerful [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]].\
* Very high maneuverability.\
* 2nd fastest [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] in the game, behind [[Helios]].\
* Higher health than its [[Jackal|regular counterpart]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No [[Turrets]].\
* Requires good [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] aim.\
* Very expensive for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* Relatively low Shield health.\
* A limited ship, making those who use it a large target.\
*One of the worst limited ships in the event due to the fact that many other ships above 180 speed can outrun it's spinals, and the [[Zhen]] is a clear example.\
*A swarm of 3 Frigates or Destroyers can obliterate your ship.\
*Pricey for such a ship.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use this Ship's relatively small profile and high mobility to avoid fire and drift around the enemy.\
== Version History ==\
*3 [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Cannons]] downsized to large variants in version .71b.\
* Large cannon count increased to 4 in version .72c20\
*Explosion size 100 ----> 520 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* Added in the first part the Halloween 2020 Event.\
* The first person to lose this ship was PeriodicTPR to an [[Alien Scourge]], as part of a [[Necromancer]] fleet baited by Kankosaurus_Rex.\
* Between the '''Jack-al'-Lantern''' and its normal buildable counterpart, the [[Jackal]]; the '''Jack-al'-Lantern''' exceeds in health by 2700 (it has 250 less shields and 3000 more hull), Top Speed by 15, Turn Speed by 0.2, and it's spinal count for both spinals by 1.\
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a D class permit (675k credits) + 5156 Sillicate, 4047Carbon, 3466 Iridium, 290 Adamantite, 290 Palladium, 290 Titanium, and 290 Quantium\

"Sugondese_Dev_Demotion","\
This article documents the events that lead to the demotion of Sugondese from Developer rank.\
== Summary ==\
On Sunday November 7th 2021, Sugondese (\"sugon\") was in the Galaxy Discord Server's General Discussion and was having general conversations. This was until ASD (a well-known community member and former admin) sent a message saying that he was moderated in the FoB (Field of Battle) Discord server for having a swear word in his custom status. This reminded sugon of how strict the moderation is in the FoB Discord. So sugon, already being in the FoB Discord Server, started to have a debate with their community regarding the server's rules. At some point sugon said \"Would I get instantly banned for saying the sh word?\" to which he was given an answer by the Admin Director of FoB Blackprincess. A few minutes later he was warned by a moderator for that message, the warning being for saying \"sh word\" in his message which references a swear word. Sugon found the warning hilarious and made a big scene about it as a joke, Blackprincess convinced sugon to take it to dms where Sugon wrote a big message with the purpose of appealing his warning, which worked. However sugon designed the message to be a copypasta, so he sent it in the Galaxy Discord Server's #misc-dev-channel.\
[[File:Sugon misc dev channel message 1.png|thumb|Sugon's first message, sending the copypasta in misc dev channel.]]\
The community, after reading the message, became outraged at the fact that sugon was moderated. An individual sent an invite to the FoB Discord Server in general discussion and from there the community stormed the FoB Discord Server sending sugon's copypasta. The FoB Community thinking that it was Sugon's doing, banned him for server raiding.\
[[File:Sugon misc dev channel message 2.png|thumb|Sugon making jokes in #misc-dev-channel about his ban.]]\
Sugon when he noticed the Community raiding, announced 3 times to stop raiding and to leave the discord alone. The community stopped but by the time they stopped it was too late, Blackprincess had locked down the FoB Discord Server and deleted all of the invite links. Sugon felt bad and Direct Messaged Blackprincess apologizing for the situation. Sugon informed Blackprincess that he was actively discouraging the raiding and was not encouraging it. Sugon and Blackprincess worked things out in dms.\
[[File:Sugon misc dev channel message 3.png|thumb|Sugon discouraging the raiding]]\
[[File:Sugon misc dev channel message 4.png|thumb|Sugon explaining what happened and to not raid again in #public-announcements]]\
However, on the morning of November 8th 2021, sugondese was demoted by rcouret.\
== Aftermath ==\
A lot of the community was put into dismay by the demotion of sugondese, as he had a lot of ambitions and plans for the game, most of which the community were desiring for years. A new movement called the #BRINGBACKSUGON2021 Movement was started, and is what caused the [[BRINGBACKSUGON2021 Incident]] where former developer XxChaoticStrike used webhooks in the Galaxy Discord to constantly ping @everyone with a pedophile accusation against a staff member and other NSFW content/messages. Sugon was left without a developer role for around a month until one day, rcouret decided to make yname a developer. But when he did that, he also made sugon a developer again.\

==Description==\
The '''Eradicator''' is the most powerful ship ever in terms of sheer damage output and can easily tear though anything that dares oppose it. It also comes with extreme maneuverability and high damage resistance, both of which increase its threat level significantly. It shares some visual likeness with the [[Prototype X-2]] and is generally built in the style of an Alien ship, but with red and yellow coloring as opposed to the classic neon green.\
\
It used to look like the Kneall prototype though.\
==Behavior==\
The '''Eradicator''' is not known to spawn naturally, so it is only a threat when purposely spawned by admins, or [[Rcouret]]. It likely behaves similarly to other Alien ships, targeting ships that approach it within a certain range or those that actively target it first. Once locked onto a target, it will either maintain a steady distance or chase after a warping target, attacking it until the target is destroyed or becomes untargetable (either through despawning or safe docking).\
\
It never stops firing if it’s turrets have line of sight, since all turrets usually get recharged around 1 second of firing, meaning it is extremely hard to tank against.\
\
The Eradicator constantly circles around its target, firing its spinals when somehow aligned against target.\
\
Extremely lethal. Do not approach.\
==Strategy==\
*Do not attempt any kind of head-on attack, even with the most powerful of [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] or [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]].\
*Use small, fast, and maneuverable ships like the [[Viper]] or [[Draco]] to draw its fire, then lure it to a [[Starbase]] or a fleet of ships that can attack it while it is distracted.\
==Loot==\
* The wreck of an '''Alien''' '''Eradicator''' drops 7,500 Alien Parts, 300(?) Dimensional Alloy, 150 Plasma Batteries, 3 Quantum Cores, 3 Alien Devices, and 1 Kneall Core.\
==Trivia==\
*Not much is known about the Eradicator aside from basic stats.\
*When spawned, it appears with a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] symbol, but enlarged to the scale of an X-0 map icon.\
*The Eradicator appears to be a recolored [[Kneall Prototype]].\
*An Eradicator was spawned on April Fools 2022. The server was shut down shortly afterwards.\

== Description ==\
The '''Rift Guardian''' is an AI ship which model, [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]] look very similar to [[Abaddon]] and [[Azreal]], and has the exact same ambient sound.\
\
2 of these and a single Rift Custodian would normally spawn within 60 minute intervals, although it used to spawn within 120 minute intervals, and used to also spawn immediately when the round started.\
\
== Strategy ==\
=== Use a Starbase ===\
Lure it towards a Level 5 Starbase through an [[Alien Serv]] or [[Alien Scourge|Alien Sourge]] call and then bring out a high DPS Dreadnought or Battleship from another base, warp over to that Level 5 Starbase, and attack it while the starbase attacks it as well. Attack the rear of the ship, since that is the blindspot for most of its turrets, while the starbase dishes out high damage, making it an easy kill.\
\
=== Use two Starbases ===\
A more risky but cost efficient way is to simply build two Level 2 Starbases and immediately lure it before alien numbers multiply.\
\
=== Bait ===\
Another way is to have an alt with you or an friend in a server with a Wyrm/Wasp to go into the Rift so it'll make the NPCs focus it. From there, you go with a high shield DPS ship and just shoot the Rift aliens until they die. After that, quickly loot the wrecks, as the Aliens can respawn while you're looting and kill you in a near-instant.\
\
Inside the rift, spinals are mostly unusable. Rift Guardians and [[Rift Custodian]]s are shield tanks, so you need ships with high turret-based shield DPS. The best ship in the game for this is the [[Jupiter]].\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Serv''' is an Alien AI ship with a unique Halloween model and color scheme. It is somewhat larger and more heavily armed than regular [[Swarmer]]s, which it appears to have replaced. Fights suggest that, unlike other Alien ships, it favors [[Hull]] over [[Shields]].\
\
== Armament ==\
The '''Serv''' is equipped with two rapid-fire laser turrets, similar to those of the [[Alien Harvest Servitor]]. It can deal unexpectedly high shield damage with these turrets, so inexperienced pilots or low-class ships are advised to avoid prolonged periods of direct fire.\
\
== Strategy ==\
Distractions with small, fast ships like the [[Viper]] and [[Draco]] are effective ways to distract this ship's fire while \"pest-control\" ships with high-accuracy turrets deal all the damage.\
\
Outside of using a simple and easy distraction ship, players may try to brute force the kill. Without avoiding the fire, this could easily end with players facing over 1000 damage to their shields, which makes this strategy rather unsustainable if players are hunting multiple '''Servs''' at once.\
\
It is also relatively easy to get in its blind spot (directly behind it) with a small spinal ship such as the Aura, which can kill it in less than a minute.\
\
While the lasers do insane shield damage, their hull damage is pitiful, meaning you should use a hull tank ship to take these ships on.\
\
Recommended ships to use to grind these are the Ampharos, due to its high accuracy turrets and its cargo hold is big enough to hold an entire serv (250 cargo).\
\
All of those strategies above have become near-impossible when it gained the ability to call aliens, making it extremely difficult to kill, especially if there is like 8-10 of these ships and [[Rift Guardian]]s/[[Rift Custodian|Custodians]], one of the reasons of it being very hard to kill is the fact that they spawn often (not to mention they replaced Swarmers during the event).\
\
== Loot ==\
*The same ores as a [[Alien Swarmer]], 14 Silicate 13 Carbon, 2 Iridium 2 Adamantite 2 Palladium, 2 Titanium, 2 Quantium, 75 Uranium\
*2 [[Gamma Pumpkin]]s.\
\
== Version History ==\
* Gamma pumpkin drop rate nerfed in version .69b1 (3 -> 2).\
*Gained the ability to call aliens in version .69[?][?] (past version .69b5).\
*Lost the ability to call aliens in version .69d[?] (note: the event already ended at that point).\
\
==Trivia==\
* 3 Small '''Servs''' are caged inside the U.N.E recruitment center in Terminal C of the [[Mega Base]].\
* The name and model appear to be a reference to Warhammer 40,000's Servo Skulls, however this is unconfirmed.\

The '''Stimulant Subjugator''' is an [[:Category:AI|'''AI''']] [[:Category:Titan|Titan]] that spawned during the duration of the [[Ultimate Retro Event 2022]].\
==Description==\
The Stimulant Subjugator is an [[AI]] Retro variant of the [[Subjugator]] that is classified as a [[:Category:Titan|Titan]] instead of a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]]. \
[[File:Stimulant Sub (hulled).png|thumb|The Stimulant Subjugator while hulled.]]\
\
==Behavior==\
It follows the same pattern as most [[AI]] ships.\
\
Its spawns every 180 minutes and only does so on Public servers.\
==Strategy==\
The Stimulant Subjugator is an extremely powerful and dangerous [[:Category:Boss|Boss]], since it only spawns on public servers, call for support from other players to take it down.\
\
Despite its incredibly intimidating HP and DPS, Stimulant Subjugator is actually laughably easy to defeat if you have a coordinated team of experienced players. Here are a few strategies that clans may use to easily destroy Stimulant Subjugator without the help of bases:\
\
'''IMPORTANT''', it is very recommended that you destroy Stimulant Andromeda before engaging Stimulant Subjugator.\
\
\
'''Method 1: Kiting'''\
\
Recommended ships for kiter: Retro Cyclops, Astraeus. If you cannot afford either, use a Judgement.\
\
The kiter warps in first, staying at 12k from Stimulant Subjugator. Take the aggro of the Stimulant Subjugator and turn away. Go away at max throttle and wait for Stimulant Subjugator to get within 8k range. Once Stimulant Subjugator is within 8k range, the rest of the people should warp to 4k-6k away from Stimulant Subjugator. '''It is very important that you do not get closer than 4k, otherwise the kiter will lose aggro. It is also important for the kiter to use their ship's long ranged turrets to shoot the Stimulant Subjugator whenever in range to keep aggro priority.''' The kiter should start a short warp to 10k away from Stimulant Subjugator when they get within 7.5k from Stimulant Subjugator. The DPS crew are to eliminate enemies in this order: Tempest -> Centurion -> Grievion -> Nyx. Once all other stimulant ships are dead, the DPS group is to target the Stimulant Subjugator. The kiter should keep kiting until Stimulant Subjugator dies.\
\
\
==Loot==\
The Stimulant Subjugator drops no loot but instead gives out 500k+ in combat rewards.\
==Trivia==\
*The old [[Subjugator]] model it uses looks similar to a blimp.\
*One of the only 2 [[AI]] ships to carry [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]], the other being the [[Pirate Waspinator]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Argonaut''' is the third tier trading ship of eight total. It usually is obtained after the [[Tempura]] although usually skipped to get better ships. This ship has more health than then [[Wyrm]] and Tempura, but is still relatively fragile. [[Aliens]] and [[Pirating|Pirates]] are easily able to obliterate it, the latter more so. It also has a recognizable hexagon shaped windows in the front part of the ship.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Argonaut '''has the same chair as many other freighters, as well as four team-colored crates in the back. The chair faces a set of three yellow screens.\
== Advantages ==\
* Decent cargo hold for the stats.\
* More health than the [[Tempura]].\
* The small figure on the [[Minimap]] makes you less likely to be noticed by [[Pirating|Pirates]].\
* Rather cheap.\
*Fast.\
*Armed.\
*Relatively small.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low health.\
* Low turn speed.\
* [[Pirating|Pirates]] find [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] to be easy targets and cheap ways to make money.\
* Docks slowly.\
* Low [[hull]] compared to shield.\
==Strategy==\
* Make sure to trade in a [[Factions|Faction]] that is in no wars and has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have wars, try your best to be safe.\
* Go to the [[Mega Base]] when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a war, there might be a pirate waiting for you.\
* Check how far away the closest [[Aliens|Alien]] is and where it is heading to.\
* Always check your trade route, there could be a pirate waiting for you anywhere.\
*Good for trading at war, high speed makes it hard for most ships that could kill you in time to keep up, small price means lower target, though you may want to try a Tempura for this.\
==Version History==\
* Received a buff in .61e4 that doubled hull and shields and gave the ship ''some'' damage resistance.\
* Cargo hold buffed from 750 to 1,250 in .65b, price increased, and received a remodel.\
*Cargo hold was buffed slightly more from 1,250 to 1,500 in version .75a10.\

== Description ==\
The '''Behemoth''' is a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]-Class ship that excels at destroying other Capital Ships. It is intended to be used broadside and is one of the longest Dreadnoughts in the game. It is equipped with powerful [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]]\

==Description==\
The '''Maple Orca''' was released in the [[:Category:Fourth of July 2021|Galaxy Fourth of July 2021 Event]].(Rereleased 6/30/22 for the Galaxy Fourth of July 2022 Event) Its a reskin of the [[Orca]] with new turrets and better stats.\
\
The '''Maple Orca''' has the same model and appearance of the Orca, but it was recolored to match the colors of the Canadian Flag\

The Maple Orca is one of the only Miners in the game to feature a proper interior. Featuring a seat with many keys and computers around it, many crates, 2 radar screens, 2 lockers and 4 co-pilot seats with screens fashioning the red and white colors of Canada.. \
==Advantages==\
*In comparison to the [[Orca]], the '''Maple Orca''' has better mining power, top speed, and acceleration/turn.\
*Mining efficiency is <s>near the same level as the [[Galaxy]] with only lacking range and mining power</s> better than that of the Galaxy.\
==Disadvantages==\
*The '''Maple Orca''' is much more expensive than the Orca.\
*Like its [[Orca|normal counterpart]], it has a big profile and susceptible to pirates or aliens.\
==Strategy==\
Don't use this ship in war whatsoever; This is a Limited ship which is very very expensive, it should not be used in war or it will be destroyed. In addition, do not use this ship in a server with high score players as they will target your ship.\
==Version History==\
* Uranium cost increased from 2000 to 4000 shortly after being released, then reduced to 1954 a few hours later.\
*Was released on limited permit build menu for a Class B Permit in version .73b1.\

"BRINGBACKSUGON2021_Incident","\
2 days after the [[Sugondese Dev Demotion|demotion of Galaxy Developer Sugondese]], the event known as the '''#BRINGBACKSUGON2021 Incident''' occurred.\
== Summary ==\
Prior to a dev reform in the Galaxy Discord, developers could get banned from the Galaxy Discord for breaking rules. When this happened developers still had their ability to make updates, and used discord webhooks in select channels to announce them. However, as this system was phased out in favor for developers not being able to be banned unless its serious, the webhooks were not deleted. So XxChaoticStrike used this as a means to wreak havoc as a prank, he was not a staff member but still had access to the webhooks which let him ping everyone.\
\
The start of the incident was a message which was sent in #dev-announcements by a webhook disguised as Galaxy Administrator SmokeyJoe38 which pinged everyone, stated that he was a pedophile, and showed an image of Smokey saying he does not believe in numbers<ref>https://imgur.com/2wXaD3P</ref>. This was deleted not too long after, to which the same exact message was sent by the same exact webhook. Everyone in the discord server had been pinged twice and #general-discussion was starting to get flooded with people wondering about the pings. Screenshots of the webhook saying the message was being spammed. Staff started to tell the community that the accusations were fake and that SmokeyJoe38 is not a pedophile<ref>https://imgur.com/QrkJsV1</ref>, with the message being resent by the webhook as a means to mock the staff<ref>https://imgur.com/Ze0lfaH</ref>. The issue quickly went out of hand with the webhook constantly sending messages pinging everyone, with some of them including pornography or including racial slurs<ref>https://imgur.com/d0qQHUV</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/kujB3Er</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/LsxEhan</ref>. One of the messages that the webhook sent was impersonating the Admin Director Rocket_GotG and said \"#BRINGBACKSUGON2021\"<ref>https://imgur.com/2W6Nf1N</ref>. Almost all of the messages the webhook sent included the phrase #BRINGBACKSUGON2021 so the incident was named after that. With almost half of the members in the Galaxy Discord active, people quickly started flooding channels with copypasta and pornography, with a lot of people trying to bypass the text filter bot to make the mod's overwhelmed<ref>https://imgur.com/jb0Koei</ref><ref>https://imgur.com/RMne5ws</ref>, which ended up working. SmokeyJoe38 got on and got really angry, making messages saying that he'll torture those who are behind the incident. #general-discussion was eventually locked down, so most of the community members resorted to using the General Voice Channel in order to speak, this Voice Channel was very chaotic and had people screaming and using soundboards, with one user sharing their screen to reveal themselves watching hardcore pornography. Rocket_GotG eventually got on, so did rcouret. They deleted the webhooks and figured out that it was Chaotic's doing, whom was banned by SmokeyJoe38 almost instantly. Eventually #general-discussion was unlocked and things turned back to normal.\

''This page is about the player-ownable vessel. If you're looking for the NPC variant, see [[Blizzard Aludra]].''\
\
The '''''Aludra''''' is a [[:Category:Limited|'''Limited''']] [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] that was introduced in the [[Christmas Event 2022|<span style=\"color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;\">Christmas Event 2022</span>]].\
==Description==\
The '''Aludra''' is a long range and hard hitting [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
\
This ship excels at providing firepower support in fleets against capital ships and [[Galaxy Terminology|Diving]] Ships with it's extremely high firepower.\
==Appearance==\
The '''Aludra''' is a mid-sized battleship that looks extremely similar to the [[Antares]], but is smaller. It has blue ice spikes and within it are blue-like spores protruding.\
\
It's interior is just a grey box.\
==Advantages==\
*Extremely long range, making it decent for [[Strategies|Sieging]].\
*High alpha makes it great for diving ships.\
*High acceleration of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.acceleration|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Aludra'}}.\
*Extremely high DPS for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]], at 322, surpassing many [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*Not much blindspots.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Struggles engaging against small ships.\
*Limited ship, possibly making it a prioritized target.\
*Must be facing towards the target to use all weapons.\
*Quite expensive for a Battleship, requiring a [[Frost Core]] and 200k Credits, along with 50 [[Ice Shard]].\
==Strategy==\
*Use your high range to your advantage in Sieges.\
*Always try to hit your spinals, they account for a large portion of your DPS.\
*Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.\
*Great for pirating because of its high DPS and [[Galaxy Terminology|Alpha]].\
==Version History==\
*Added in version .75a37 as Part 2 of the [[Christmas Event 2022|<span style=\"color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;\">Christmas Event 2022</span>]].\
*Changed price, requiring a [[Frost Core]] to build in the same version as above.\
==Trivia==\
\
* The Quest to obtain this ship is given by an NPC named [[Operator]]. \
\
* The first person to lose this ship was penguinscanfly24 to Deklxnn's [[Apocalypse]].\

''This article describes an NPC boss ship. For the player ship with an identical appearance, see [[Obliterator]].''\
\
\
The '''''Decimator''''' is an '''[[:Category:AI|AI]] [[:Category:Alien|Kneall]]''' boss ship.\
== Description ==\
The '''Decimator''' is a large, powerful [[Aliens|Alien]] ship that can be extremely dangerous if not handled carefully. Though it deals immense damage towards both shield and hull, it is generally better at damaging hull, as most of its weapons are railguns and contains 8 Huge Torpedoes with a 200-second interval, and 8 Large Cannons.\
==Behavior==\
Decimator's AI is the same as most [[AI]] Ships in the game.\
\
'''It spawns every 60 minutes.'''\
== Strategy ==\
\
This ship's firepower leans more on hull damage, so use a shield-based ship such as the [[Judgement]], or a tank such as the [[Prometheus]].\
\
'''Avoid its front''', the Decimator's front make up the bulk of its damage at a whopping 400+ DPS. \
\
\
The main and best way to deal with the Decimator is to get extremely near it ''(>1500 Studs)'', to force it to turn around, losing most of its DPS. Most, if not all [[Build Menu|BM]] [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] could take down the Decimator via this strategy without even getting hulled.\
\
''Since it doesn't call for allies when being attacked, it is unsurprisingly less threatening than the [[Punisher]] if the strategy above is used.''\
\
== Loot ==\
The wreck of a '''''Decimator''''' contains 200 [[Alien Part]]s, 35k in Combat Rewards and 8 Plasma Batteries.\
==Version History==\
*Spawns disabled during parts of the [[:Category:Fourth of July 2021|2021 Fourth of July Event]] ''(.72e)''.\
*Gained 8 Huge Torpedoes with a 200-second interval in version .73c10.\
*HP buff 7500/5750 -> 8500/7000, gained Kneall Autolaser and 8 Large Cannons, drops 8 Plasma Batteries now, and Cr increase due to buff. (.75a8)\
*8 Huge Torpedoes and Interval nerfed to 10 Large Torpedoes and 900 seconds in an unknown version.\
*No Longer Targets [[Mega Base]] and can no longer call for allies in an unknown version.\
*Spawns in open space instead of spawning on top of the [[Mega Base]] in version .73a37.\
==Trivia==\
*Is capable of decimating Ships and [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]] alike with the aid of a fleet.\
*Was originally hinted in the [[Judgement]]'s description.\
*The second AI boss ship to not be added during an event ''(After Kodiak)''.\
*Has a similar ship icon to the [[Rift Guardian]] and [[Rift Custodian]]. \
*It will always answer [[Punisher]]'s call when the [[Punisher]] is present.\
*This ship has the highest spinal interval, coming at an insanely high 900 second interval from the 10 Large Torpedoes.\

}}\
==Description==\
The '''Warden''' is a shield-breaker counterpart to the [[Hawklight]], and has many similarities to its counterpart aside of the health type it excels at countering.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Warden''' has a fairly interesting interior containing a teleport pad to the interior where there is control panels to the left and right of the interior, there is also a chair in the middle.\
==Advantages==\
* Incredible efficiency at destroying [[Shields]], being better than the [[Zeus]] and (barely) the [[Retro Aegis]] at shield breaking.\
* Second cheapest Battleship, behind [[Prowler]] by 600 credits (Although it is a [[warehouse]] level higher).\
* Balanced [[turrets]].\
* Cheaper than it's [[Hawklight|hull breaking counterpart.]]\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Target needs to be a little above for all turrets to fire.\
* Somewhat mediocre [[Shields|Shield]] health, although it is enough to be sufficient for tanking kinetic weaponry for a while.\
* Blind spot underneath.\
* Mediocre [[Hull]] damage output, although it is better than the [[Prowler]].\
* Requires good spinal aim, as over a vast majority of the [[Shields|Shield]] damage output comes from them.\
== Strategy ==\
* Extremely good at defending [[Starbase]]s; the low cost makes it less likely to be focused by a fleet, and the shield shredding properties will quickly scare any attackers into retreating.\
* Use this ship to counter Cruisers, Battlecruisers or Battleships. It won't do well against ships bigger than itself or extremely agile ships.\
== Version History ==\
* Buffed in .66b, having its shield go from 4000 to 2750 and its hull going from 2000 to 4150, as well as its light gatling laser being changed to a Medium Flak Cannon.\
* 2 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] and 1 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannon]] removed and [[Hull]] reduced to 3150 in version .69a1.\
*Explosion Size 45 ----> 270 .75a12\
== Trivia  ==\
* The '''Warden''' is supposed to be the [[Hawklight|Hawklight's]] shield-breaker counterpart.\
* Somewhat better than the [[Hawklight]] if used correctly.\
* The '''Warden''' has the same mobility as the hawklight, as well as the exact opposite weapon loadout and shield/hull.\

The '''Abandoned U.N.E Base''' was added in [[Christmas Event 2017|2017 Christmas Update]]. (.60). U.N.E stands for [[United Nations of Earth|''United Nations of Earth'']]. This [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] is an abandoned human-built base and is one of the only things in the game that contains lore related to Galaxy.\
\
This base can be upgraded up to level three. The first upgrade costs 3000 credits and adds 1000 health to each stat, as well as 4 medium railguns and 4 medium lasers. The second upgrade costs 6000 credits, adds another 1000 health to each stat, and adds another 6 medium lasers, giving the base considerable defensive firepower.\
== Territory ==\
The '''Abandoned U.N.E Base''' can gain territory and power like any normal [[starbase]], and can only be captured through [[Assimilations|assimilation]] by a Faction. Just like the [[Mothership]], '''this base cannot be captured by shooting it.''' When assimilated, their economy can be viewed just like any other [[Starbase]], and buying/selling materials and dumping ore there is always possible.\
== Interior ==\
The interior of this Station is massive, with the Control room having half the size of [[Mega Base|Mega Base's]] interior. The outer hall is twice the size of [[Derelict Station]], and the docking rooms span the width of the [[Freedom Base]].\
\
The central U.N.E control room contains the bodies of many armed U.N.E soldiers, similar to the devastation seen in the outer halls. The center of the room is occupied by a large computer, which has a terminal still in order. This terminal allows players to open a chat box and discover the lore behind the base's destruction.\
\
In the outer halls, crates lay upright and pushed over for unknown reasons. The walls are riddled with bullet holes, and swords and guns lay discarded throughout the base. There is also a green, humanoid figure of some kind half hidden behind a partly closed hatch. This could possibly be the remains of some sort of [[Aliens|Alien]] similar to those seen at the Alien Embassy in the Mega Base.\
== Trivia ==\
* This is the first and only [[Starbase]] to have 0 shields at its base level. This is widely attributed to the lore of the base.\
* One of the only things in the game that contains a solid historical account about events in Galaxy.\
* There are no teleporters to the center of the base, so it's recommended not to mine here if you do not have escorts.\
* You're able to access the menu in both docking areas. This helps players walk a shorter distance to de-spawn or dump their ore.\
* Makes a random alarm sound time to time.\
* If you are boom mining this base, bring a hull breaker such as a Ridgebreaker, as it has no shields and you will be able to use it to its maximum effectiveness.\

The '''Freedom Base''' is a [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] that was added during the [[Galaxy Star Wars Event]] update. It has 7500 shield and 7500 hull while being unarmed, even at Level 3. Its behavior is the same as all other [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]]. \
==Interior==\
The Freedom Base has 8 terminals and 3 floors. On the 1st floor, there are 4 Computers, one having [[Strange Character]] beside it. There is also a transparent elevator that leads to the 2nd floor, which is a much larger room consisting of many computers, including [[Material Scrap]] computers and 2 Elevators, one leading to the 3rd Floor. The 3rd Floor is a small room in which what looks like an observation deck due to having walls made entirely out of glass, there is also a [[Material Scrap]] computer here.\
==Quests==\
*[[Strange Character|Nautilus Blueprint Quest]]\
*[[Material Scrap|Material Scrap Quests]]\
==Version History==\
*Fixed the hole left by [[Uncle Sam]] in version 75a12.\
*Received a remodel and overhaul at the same time as the [[Fourth of July 2022|2022 Fourth of July Event]] in 75a12.\
==Trivia==\
*The only [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] that is unarmed at max level.\
*In 2018, YouTubers found out that you could still get the event item by completing the '''Freedom Base''' quest and mass-produced videos on how to do it, leading to hundreds of players joining Galaxy for that one reason. Unfortunately, within two weeks of Conor3D uploading his video on these quests for Freedom Base and [[Derelict Station]], the event gear items could no longer be obtained.\
*Quest #1 - \"Help The Freedom Base\" had made a return for the duration of the [[Christmas Event 2018]], however, the quest can only be activated when the '''Freedom Base''' [[Starbase]] is in the server. \
*Players used to be able to earn the Interstellar Sunglasses and the \"Help The Freedom Base\" badge ''(now called Complete Quest 1)'' by delivering 3 crates of Medicine & Supplies to the Freedom Base as part of a new quest system adding in the Star Wars Event update. \
*A model of the [[Shady Dealer]] lays splayed out on the top of the old Freedom Base.\
*On the floor with the docking bay of the old Freedom Base, a NPC that is likely a member of the U.N.E is seen writing up a report on damage done to the docking door. When interacted with, the NPC informs the player that \"some nutjob dressed like Uncle Sam rammed his ship out of the docking bay.\" This is likely a reference to the [[Uncle Sam]] NPC, who awarded players the [[Freedom Galaxy]] during the [[:Category:Fourth of July 2020|2020 Fourth of July Event]], as the NPC was added after the event's end.\

The '''''Waspinator''''' is a limited [[:Category:Carrier|'''Carrier-Miner''']] hybrid released during the [[April Fool's Event 2022]].\
\
==Description==\
'''The Waspinator''' is an April Fool's-themed combat miner carrier with [[Wasp?]] [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] and Mining Lasers as weaponry. \
[[File:WaspinatorSwarm.png|thumb|left|[[Wasp?]] Fighters engaging an enemy ship.]]\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
==Appearance==\
The Waspinator is identical to the model of the [[Wasp]], but made extremely large, to the point where it is bigger than most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]. There is a floating teleporter on the far front of the Carrier, and leads to a teleporter just infront of the pilot seat.\
[[File:Waspinator-Teleporter.png|thumb|left|Teleporter leading to the entrance of the ship.]]\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The Fighter bay is simply a row of [[Wasp?]] Fighters lined up above it's engines.\
\
The Interior is identical to the [[Wasp]].\
==Advantages==\
*The '''Fastest and Most-agile [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]]''' in the game, with an astounding 0.6 Turn Speed, which is as fast as [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]].\
*Turret is long range and extremely accurate, capable of hitting even [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers.]]\
*Intimidating.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Low hull-based DPS.\
*Huge, and can be hit easily with [[Spinal Weaponry|Torpedoes]].\
*Expensive.\
*Low health for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
==Strategy==\
*Keep this ship as a trophy.\
*Abuse the 9K turret range of Wasp? against ships (can also be used to anti-seige if enemy is too scared)\
\
*<s>Scare Most Players with this Ship, even [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]] would run away seeing this warp to them.</s>\
==Version History==\
*Added in version .75a9, after the introduction of the [[April Fool's Event 2022]].\
*Price of the ship was increased tenfold twice after its initial release in .75a9.\
==Trivia==\
*The first person to lose a Waspinator was undeadzombie12234567 to a CeruleanBrine's [[Prototype X-2]].\
\
*The only [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]]-class Ship to have Mining Lasers as it's weapon.\
\
*The only [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]]-class ship that was used by an [[AI]] faction, The [[Pirates]], and the only AI Ship that was a Carrier in-game.\
\
*If you somehow were able to target an ore, it's turrets will give an error saying \"Ore Hold Full\".\
\
*During the event, this ship's Galaxypedia page was redirected to a rickroll video link.\

==Description==\
The '''Prospector''' is a [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]]-Class ship that has the fifth highest cargo capacity for its class. It is slightly faster than the [[Hercules]], making it a good choice for traders who want a faster ship as a backup for the [[Hercules]].\
==Appearance==\
The '''Prospector''' is entered through a metal door on the back that leads to a larger room. To the left of the entrance is a set of three crates, a bed, and a small nightstand with a decal and lamp on it. Stairs to the right of the bed lead up to a bridge with a decorated pilot's seat and three yellow screens.\
==Advantages ==\
*Faster than the [[Hercules]].\
*6th largest Cargo Hold of all [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]].\
*A good choice for those that like to trade safely, as smaller [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] are targeted less often.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Somewhat slow.\
*A target for [[Pirating|Pirates]].\
*Low health for its price.\
==Strategy==\
*Make sure to trade in a neutral [[factions|Faction]] that hopefully has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have [[Factions]] all at [[War]], try [[Trading]] close to the [[Mega Base]] instead.\
*Go to the [[Mega Base]] when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a war. There might be a [[Pirating|Pirate]] or two waiting for you.\
*Check how far away the closest [[aliens|Alien]] is and where it is heading.\
==Version History==\
*Received buffs in .61e4 that doubled [[Hull]] and [[Shields]], and gave the ship ''some ''damage resistance.\
*Buffed in .65b - [[Shields|Shield]] increased from 700 to 1200, [[Hull]] increased from 1050 to 1500, Cargo Hold increased from 1000 to 1750, price increased somewhat. Also received a remodel.\
*In version .75a10, the ship was put offsale. \
==Trivia==\
*You can make back what you spent buying this ship quickly by [[Trading]].\
[[File:RBGalaxyProspector.jpg|thumb|192x192px|Oldest Prospector Model]]\
*Originally called The Crowbar.\
*The description is a reference towards the first model of the ship.\
*Has a limited, stronger, and more expensive version, the [[Clauspector|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Clauspector</span>]].\
*The '''Prospector''' looks like a smaller version of the [[Prepravca]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Tengu''' is a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] that can deal tremendous damage whilst also being able to tank damage fairly well with its large health pool.\
\
== Appearance ==\
The interior consists of a single corridor with several detailed display screens, ending in a pilot seat at the front positioned in front of a display screen. The ships docks from the rear to a single open door.\
Its exterior consists of several black, patterned plates, two large spinal launchers, and four engines. Its front end curves around in a manner reminiscent of past models of the [[Apocalypse]].\
== Advantages ==\
* Great Acceleration.\
* Decent Cargo Hold.\
* [[Spinals]] can all shoot at the same time, creating a high damage output if they hit.\
* Relatively large health pool, enough to last a little while against a [[Punisher]].\
* More [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower than the [[Razor Wing]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* The second slowest [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] to date.\
* Vulnerable from most angles besides the front.\
== Strategy ==\
* Always try to aim for where the enemy ship is going.\
* Don't buy this ship if you're not good with [[Spinals|Spinal]] weaponry.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a remodel in .61h(?)\
* Remodel reverted in .64c\
* Remodeled in version .66b\
*Temporarily disabled in version Unknown\
== Trivia ==\
* Before the '''Tengu''' had its [[Spinals|Torpedoes]] removed, it was one of the only two ships in the game that could fire multiple [[Spinals|Torpedoes]] at once, the other being the [[Avalon]].\
* The old '''Tengu''' model was based on the Tengu from EVE online.\
* It used to have 2 [[Spinals|Small Torpedoes]] and 4 [[Spinals|Small Phasers]], essentially making it an oversized [[Starblade]].\
\
* Its old design is fairly similar to the [[Nyx]] and [[Nixesion|Nyxesion]], using the same color scheme and material.\
\
* This ship was previously disabled and was \"awaiting reductions.\" It was in this state for quite possibly the longest time of ''any'' ship in Galaxy.\
* Name is from a legendary creature in Japanese Folk Religion. They are supernatural, and take the form of a bird-man.\

== Description ==\
The '''Wyrm''' is given to the player for free at the beginning of the game. This ship is used to transport ores or loot wrecks. It is urged that beginners get this loot from destroyed ships and bases.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Wyrm''' has a small but still relatively detailed interior. The pilot's seat has team-colored padding. The seat faces a set of three blue screens below a glowing cylinder, suggesting the screens are holographic projections.\
== Advantages ==\
* Easy to begin [[Trading]] with.\
* Easy to control.\
* Small and hard to hit.\
* Great for salvaging small wrecks.\
* Not much of a target by [[Pirating|Pirates]].\
* High Acceleration.\
* It's free.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Small Cargo Hold for a [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]], so the profit from [[Trading]] is minimal.\
* Low overall health.\
==Strategy==\
* Make sure to trade in a[[Factions|Faction]] that is in no wars and has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have [[War]]s, try your best to be safe and try to join one with the least if possible.\
* Go to the [[Mega Base]] when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a [[War]], there might be a [[Pirating|Pirate]] waiting for you.\
* Check how far away [[Aliens]] are and where they are heading to.\
*You may take some risks with this ship as it is free to rebuild. However, note that you will lose all the cargo you were carrying upon destruction.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in version .34.\
* Made a free ship and given to new players starting in version .56.\
* Received a remodel in version .65b.\
== Trivia ==\
* Each new player is given a [https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/Wasp Wasp] and a '''Wyrm''', once it was destroyed, players can re-buy it for '''free'''.\
* This can give you a profit of 225 if you get a full cargo of silicate at a 5 price and sell at the [[Mega Base]].[[File:Wyrm.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Old Wyrm Model]]\
* In previous versions of the game, the '''Wyrm''' used to require resources to rebuild upon destruction, though that has already changed.\
* There is an armed version of this ship called the [[Worm]].\
* A trading group could (in theory) make a safe profit off of using several '''Wyrm'''s instead of one ship, due to very little profits off of [[Pirating]].\
* Has a limited event counterpart, the [[Festive Wyrm|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Festive Wyrm</span>]].\
* The ship emits a long lavender trail.\
* One of only two continuously available free ships, the other being the [[Wasp]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Lusso''' is a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] with four [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannons]] and twelve [[Spinals|Tiny Phasers]]. Its [[Spinals]] fire like a minigun and reload very quickly. If you use the ship's [[Spinals]] correctly with its [[Turrets|Flak Cannons]] you can do large amounts of shield and hull damage.\
\
The '''Lusso''' is a fast ship with a top speed of 170 and a very high turn speed of 0.6. Overall, it is a good [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]], as it has good firepower and a great interior. Its only downside is that it's very expensive for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]], but still very cheap compared to most ships. If you are not good with [[Spinals]], you won't be able to do any significant damage to shields. This ship is great for attacking smaller ships. However, it dies very quickly because this ship has low health.\
\
The '''Lusso''' also has many team-colored accents all around the exterior. Making it very easy to identify the faction of the player it's owned by.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Lusso''' has a very luxurious interior, with various paintings, art-like structures including some classic Roblox items and even a relatively fancy pilot's seat, in a separate cockpit with even more fancy items and decor.\
== Advantages ==\
* Good acceleration and turn speed.\
* High damaging [[Spinals]].\
* Great for attacking ships of the same size or smaller like [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low shield health.\
* Lack of [[Turrets]] on the bottom.\
* Without [[Spinals]] it is hard to damage shields.\
* Somewhat easy to hit, making it hard to fight larger ships.\
== Strategy ==\
* Face your opponent to let all the [[Turrets]] hit him while you fire the [[Spinals]].\
* Stay away from an enemy [[Starbase]]. It may be a fatal error without a strong ship supporting you.\
* Work with a hull shredding ship for maximum effectiveness.\
*Be sure to avoid any ship that is larger than it.\
== Version History ==\
* Small interior changes in an unknown version.\
* Turret bug fix in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Lusso''' model has broken three times in-game and has needed to get fixed each time.\
* The opposite of the [[Sixfold]], as it has 12 [[Spinals|Phasers]] instead of cannons and hull based [[Turrets]] instead of laser-based, as well as the exact opposite health.\
* Formerly featured on one of the screens at the [[Mega Base]].\

== Appearance ==\
The '''Dramiel''' has a very sparse interior with few decorations, apart from some stickers and small constructions.\
== Advantages ==\
* Powerful [[Spinals]].\
* Very fast and maneuverable for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].\
\
* Being small and flat, it is hard to hit with heavier weapons.\
* Good evasive factor.\
* Since few people know about this ship, your weaknesses are lesser known.\
* Currently the highest non-limited dps cruiser\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low overall health pool, making this ship expensive and easy to lose.\
* Low [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
* Expensive for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] class ship.\
* Requires experience in order to land the [[Spinals]].\
* You can only deal decent shield damage with the [[Spinals]].\
* Small blind spot underneath it.\
== Strategy ==\
* Make sure all your [[Spinals]] hit.\
* Use your maneuverability to keep in the blind spots of larger ships.\
* Use your acceleration to run in danger.\
* Use multiple in swarms to unleash PURE SPINAL FURY!\
* Use your fast speed drift close around medium-large size ships\
== Version History ==\
* Received a remodel in version .67e?\
== Trivia ==\
* One of the most oddly shaped ships, with players often calling it a Pokémon or a crab.\
\
* One of the most obscure ships with many people not even knowing of its existence.\
* The interior has the logo for Outpost Eighteen, a reference to the Outpost Eighteen Galaxy Group.\
* The name and previous model are based on a [http://eve.wikia.com/wiki/Dramiel ship] from EVE Online.\
* It's basically [[Razor Wing|Razor wing]]'s brother because it's [[Spinals|Spinal]] capability rivals the Razorwing.\
*One of the noticeable differences the Razor wing has over the Dramiel is that it also has 3 [[Turrets|Flak Cannons]] compared to the Dramiel's 2, Another difference that the Razorwing has over the Dramiel is that it has more Alpha than the Dramiel, (348 Dramiel's alpha, compared to 493 Razorwing's alpha)\
*Just as good if not better at pirating than the Razorwing.\
* It kind of looks like a smaller [[Nova]].\

__NOTOC__\
== Description ==\
The '''Absolution''' is a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] with many details ranging from a large half tube that houses the [[Spinals]], to the large hole in the middle of the ship.\
\
It can deal massive damage with its two [[Spinals|Large Cannons]]. Its [[Turrets]] are located on the top. With four [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]] and two [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannons]], this is a great alternative to the [[Razor Wing]].\
== Appearance ==\
The interior is largely inaccessible and is hard to make out what is inside, due to collision issues with the ship's model. It does however, possess at least a bare-bones interior of a square pilot seat and some surrounding walling from what is visible.\
== Advantages ==\
* High overall [[Turrets|Turret]] and [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower.\
* Decent mobility for a [[Ships|Ship]] of its Class.\
* High overall health.\
* Great for taking down small [[ships]].\
* Able to take down larger [[ships]] if you exploit their blind spots.\
* [[Spinals]], being large, have long range.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Vulnerable bottom.\
* Unbalanced damage, better at taking down shields.\
* One of the more expensive Battlecruisers.\
== Strategy ==\
* Attack from below other ships if you can. Your mobility should allow you to stay below most ships.\
* Utilize your powerful [[Spinals|Large Cannons]] to maximize damage.\
== Version History ==\
* Nerfed in .58b—lost 350 shield.\
* Buffed in the Battlecruiser Rebalance (version .64d), gained 800 shield.\
* Remodeled in .64f\
* Max Shield increased from 1500 to 1650 in .65b.\
* in the same version, Absolution received it's large cannon back.\
* Absolution received trails 66b.\
* Model reverted to original model in ???.\
* Received another [[Spinals|Large Cannon]] in version .69a2.\
* Remodeled in unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* One of the ships involved in a long remodeling process\
* The '''Absolution''' is likely to be based on the ship [https://fracturedspace.fandom.com/wiki/Aegis Aegis] from the game Fractured Space.\
* The [[Galaxy|Galaxy's]] interior closely resembles the '''Absolution's.'''\
* Nicknamed \"Abso\".\
* One of the only [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] without a teleport pad.\

The '''''ShieldSide''''' is a \"Fighter\" found on each side of the [[Subjugator]].\
\
== Description ==\
The '''ShieldSide's''' primary purpose as implied in the name; is to act as a static, physical shield on the [[Subjugator]]. It's fairly large in size, but is only really effective against incoming turret firepower from the sides. \
==Appearance==\
The ShieldSide looks like its, name, a Shield, with 2 equipped on each side of the [[Subjugator]]. The ShieldSide is extremely long, almost spanning length of the [[Subjugator]]. It is curved, with a blue-ish color and has hexagonal textures on themselves.\
== Advantages ==\
*Highest health out of all [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]]-class ships.\
*Incredibly effective at tanking kinetic weaponry.\
*Large size allows it to function well as a shield for the [[Subjugator]].\
*Acts as an expendable health for the already extremely high health of the [[Subjugator]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
*Incredibly weak to anti-shield weaponry, not to mention ships with very high alpha damage are able to wipe this shield out in a single volley.\
*Due to being a \"Fighter\"-class ship, the shields have 0% Damage resistance.\
*Only is effective at tanking against [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower; [[Spinal Weaponry]] passes right through the shields as if they're not there.\
*Can block [[Turrets|turret]] line of sight of the '''Subjugator''' at some firing angles.\
*Doesn't cover the entirety of the '''Subjugator's''' sides, as it falls short of covering the far ends (the front and rear of the ship on each side respectively).\
== Strategy ==\
*Position your '''Subjugator''' well in order to make full use of the ShieldSides, as they act as expendable health.\
*Always face the enemy at your sides in order to use these well.\
*It is better to use this to tank against Capital Ships rather than swarms, because swarms rely on spinals to do damage, which ShieldSide cannot protect [[Subjugator]] from.\
== Version History ==\
<!--There are most likely some missing log entries here, due to the page creation having been done so late after the existence of this ship. Try to add any previous changes if possible.-->\
*Health changed from unknown amount<sup>(please add former shield health amount)</sup> to 9,500/1 Shield/Hull HP in unknown version<sup>(please add version when possible)</sup>.\
*9,500 changed to 8,500 Shields in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
*Due to it being a Fighter, it can re-spawn, or rather \"Regenerate\" after a period of time.\
*The only \"Fighter\" that is present on a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]].\
*The first ship of its type to be introduced into the game, and also unique in that it is the only Fighter unable to be piloted.\
*Despite having spinals, the ShieldSide cannot be piloted, making them useless.\
*There used to be a ShieldFront counterpart to this ship on the [[Subjugator]], but it was removed from that ship. It was similar to this ship, except that it had a smaller profile.\
*The [[UNE Subjugator]] lacks both of these in each sides of the ship, unlike its playable counterpart.\

== Description ==\
The '''Orion''' is a slow [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]]. It carries 2 [[Turrets|Small Lasers]] and 1 [[Turrets|Medium Laser]], it is capable of good [[Spinals|Spinal Weaponry]] use, but is slow for a ship of its class.\
== Appearance ==\
On the back of the '''Orion''' is a teleporter that leads to a small room which contains nothing but the pilot's seat. The current model is partially broken due to an admin deleting several ship meshes.\
== Advantages ==\
* High-damaging [[Spinals]].\
* Decent support ship.\
* Highest health of any non-event Cruiser.\
*A few light [[turrets]] to defend against small ships.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Vulnerable bottom and sides.\
* Slow for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].\
* Not much [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower, they do not do much against capital ships.\
* Lack of Flak or Cannon Turrets, meaning you must use its Spinals in order to deal [[Hull]] damage.\
* Large for a Cruiser.\
== Strategy ==\
* Escort larger ships for sieges and use its Small Cannons to kill attacking ships.\
* Moderately effective against a single [[Swarmer|Alien Swarmer]], but does not fare well against larger groups.\
*Use your [[Spinals]] to deal damage to capital ships, and your [[Turrets]] to attack small ships.\
==Version History==\
* Gains 2 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Cannons]] replacing its [[Turrets|Light Cannon]] and [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannon]] and gained 1 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Laser]] replacing 1 [[Spinals|Small Cannon]] in version .75a3.\
*Added 2 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] (\"G\" Spinal) and changed [[Turrets|Medium Laser]] to [[Turrets|Dual Medium Laser]] in version .65b.\
== Trivia ==\
* Named after a famous star constellation, '''Orion''' the Hunter.\
* The current model is based on the [http://galaxyonfire.wikia.com/wiki/Veteran Veteran] from Galaxy on Fire 2.\
* The [[United Nations of Earth|U.N.E]] have used this ship in the past.\

== Description ==\
The '''Dire Wolf''' is a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] with a unique [[Turrets|Turret]] layout, high firepower, and decent health. It is very combat-oriented with equal [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] damage. Its name is written on both sides of the ship. It has a very unique, recognizable design.\
\
It is also said to be the \"best\" ship from Rcouret.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Dire Wolf''' contains a pilot seat with a screen on the front. Behind it is a hallway with many seats and displays and a table showing a Galaxy map. Behind that is a reactor room with a control panel that is similar to the Chimera.\
== Advantages ==\
* High firepower against both [[Shields]] and [[Hull]].\
* Decent health in both shields and hull.\
* Good speed.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* It suffers from low mobility for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser.]]\
* [[Spinals]] fire one after the other, not at the same time, making it hard to hit with both against faster targets.\
* Vulnerable bottom \
* 3rd most expensive [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] in the build menu.\
*Very easy to hit.\
== Strategy ==\
* Can easily fire at enemies above it.\
* Great as a support ship among a fleet.\
* Use of [[Spinals]] are necessary to destroy [[Hull]] so fighting with others is recommended.\
* In PVP, face your opponent straight on so all your [[Turrets]] [[Spinals]] can hit; drifting is recommended\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled in an unknown version.\
* 1 [[Turrets|Medium Laser]] moved to the top of the ship, 2 [[Spinals|Medium Cannons]] upsized to 2 [[Spinals|Large Cannons]] and Top Speed increased from 130 to 140 in version .68e.\
* 2 Medium Flak cannons replaced with 2 Medium Point Defense Lasers in version .72d4.\
== Trivia ==\
* The Dire Wolf's model is based on the 2nd SSV Normandy from the original Mass Effect trilogy.\
* Two '''Dire Wolves''' are enough to take on a [[Nemesis]] if the pilots are skilled enough.\
* The Control panel in the reactor room is the same as the one in the [[Chimera]].\
*One of the ships Rcouret likes to spawn in game.\
* Originally, this ship was one of the gamepasses in [[Galaxy Arcade]]. This feature was removed later on. It received another gamepass in version .69d1.[[File:Direwolf-0-0.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Old Dire Wolf Model]]\

==Description==\
The '''Warlord''' is a \"Rough 'n' Tumble\" type of [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]], with versatile [[Turrets]] and authoritative [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] called the [[Raptor]]. This versatile ship is ideal at either back-line support or for facing [[ships]] head-on when it's caught in the fray.\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Warlord '''is a small grey room containing the pilot's seat and two teleporters leading to the left and right hangars. The interior is very buggy as you can walk through many walls.\
==Advantages==\
* Versatile and well-placed [[Turrets]].\
* Powerful and unique [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* Large Cargo Hold making for an ideal (yet unconventional) [[Pirating|Pirate]] ship.\
* Ability to engage in combat without the use of its fighters.\
*High Shield damage, able to fight [[Punisher]]s and the [[Aliens]] it calls by itself.\
*Relatively cheap to equip all fighters with AI pilots, only costing 1000 robux without VIP.\
*Relatively small compared to other Carriers.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Low Fighter count.\
* Has 2 blind spots, specifically towards the back and bottom of the [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
*Sluggish.\
*Fighters have <u>very</u> low health.\
*Aiming all the turrets can be difficult at times.\
==Strategy==\
* The '''Warlord''' is useful for a spearhead attack if you are accompanied by other [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]].\
* Thanks to its [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]], it is able to defend itself from smaller ships while also being able to engage larger ships. \
*You could play it like a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], that is engage your enemy head on, as it has high DPS and high healthpool.\
*OR you could be back-line support, have your fighters attack other ships while using your turrets for self defense.\
==Version History==\
* Added in version .65b.\
* Health increased from 5750/5800 to 9100/8700, 4 light cannons replaced with 4 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]] in version .68d.\
==Trivia==\
*This ship, for now, has the most amount of transparent textures of any Carriers.\
* Shares an extremely heavy resemblance in terms of design to the [[Marauder]].\
* Almost identical to the Daedalus from Stargate (Most likely the inspiration).\
* Made in [[The Cultists|The Cultist]] shipyards.\

== Description ==\
The D '''''Class''''' is a massive [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]]. It has a moderate amount of health and resistance, despite being more expensive than some dreadnoughts, however it has a huge cargo hold (totaling 7,500) and is remarkably fast for its size.\
== Appearance ==\
Features the same interior as the previous [[E Class|E-Class]] model.\
== Advantages ==\
*has 30x the cargohold of the [[Wyrm]] and has 3x the cargohold of the [[Hercules]].\
*good health for its class.\
*Can easily make thousands of Credits per run even if the Economy is poor, so long as there are enough Ores for you to buy and *enough credits at another base for you to sell.\
*Somewhat fast for its size.\
*Docks as \"Safe\" at bases, meaning it is completely invulnerable when docked.\
== Disadvantages ==\
*Low damage resistance.\
*Terrible acceleration and turn speed makes it hard to escape quickly.\
*Extremely expensive for a Freighter.\
*Very vulnerable alone.\
*Pirates consider this ship the ultimate target since it's slow, defenseless, extremely expensive, and it often takes a long time to *dock at the Mega Base compared to most ships.\
*When trading, finding enough Ores can be an issue.\
*Can break the Economy after a few trades, limiting its effective usage.\
*Takes time to make back the amount of money it costs.\
*Rather long, making it easy to hit with spinals and turrets.\
*Large target.\
== Strategy ==\
* Never trade while in a war to avoid being destroyed, as you are very vulnerable to attack. If it is vital that you trade, use smaller, cheaper freighters instead, such as the [[Hercules]], as even with an escort you are still taking a huge risk.\
*Care should be taken to avoid surprise wars being declared mid-way through a trade run, as it may struggle to dock in time if poorly positioned.\
*Check the [[Minimap]] often for [[Pirating|Pirates]].\
*Stay next to friendly combat ships.\
*This ship is an effective tool for VIP servers especially when trying to do a low player count eco server. Refer to the [[Trading|trading tab]] on how to set one up.\
== Version History ==\
* Hull nerfed from 6,000 to 4,000&nbsp;hp in an unknown version.\
* Shield nerfed from 3500 to 3250&nbsp;hp in an unknown version.\
*In version .75a10, this ship was put offsale.\
== Trivia ==\
*Resized version of the old e-class, probably because lazy devs. (Info needed on version history).\
*This ship is not used often cause most people skip it and go straight towards [[E Class|E-Class]].\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Hearteater''' is a Pirate-affiliated AI ship that ruthlessly shreds both the [[Shields]] and [[Hull]] of any ship if not attacked with care, due to its armament having very high damage output for a Battleship.\
== Strategy ==\
*Given that this ship will significantly damage most ships that try to attack it (and will almost certainly destroy them if in swarms), try to fight them one at a time with a strong [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]](with [[AI Fighters]]), or [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]]. Beware the fact that these ships are capable of calling all other Pirates present on the map.\
*'''Do not attempt to take out the ''Hearteaters'' if there is three or more of them with a ship.''' This is because a swarm of them are very dangerous, unless you know what you're doing and fielding a powerful ship with high alpha damage like the [[Prototype X-1]], [[Astraeus]] or [[Judgement]]. Instead, deploy a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]](preferably one with many fighters) and use the [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to destroy the them.\
*If fighting one of these head-on by itself, ensure that you get close enough to force it to turn away and not be able to shoot its spinals at you.\
== Loot ==\
For its power, the ship drops a measly loot of [[Materials|3 Plasma Batteries]]; on top of no Combat Rewards due to the ship having no value.\
== Version History ==\
*Heartifact Accelerator turrets nerfed: loses two barrels, resulting in a reload rate reduction in version .75a5.\
*Disabled from spawning in an undocumented version.\
*Ship class upgraded from Battleship to Super Capital, and stats changed in an unknown version:\
**Health changed from 2,300 [[Shields|Shield]] and 4,500 [[Hull]] to 29,000 Shield and 29,000 Hull.\
**Top speed increased from 120 to 320, and Acceleration increased from 20 to 50.\
**Cargo Hold increased from 1 to 2500, and Explosion Radius value increased from 600 to 1244.\
**Armament changed:\
***4 Heartifact AcceleratorL and 4 Heavy Heartifact Accelerator [[Turrets]] changed to 2 Siege Cannons, 4 Heavy Heartifact Lances, and 2 Heavy Heartifact Accelerators.\
***6 Large Cannon spinals changed to 12 Huge Phasers and 12 Huge Cannons.\
== Trivia ==\
*The first person to lose their ship to a '''Hearteater''' was BADZAMAN with his [[Draco]].\
*Many players have lost large and expensive [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]] to this foe. This is certainly not an enemy to underestimate.\

==Description==\
The '''Retro Leviathan''' is a limited [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] featuring the [[Leviathan]]'s original model and armament. Like its modern counterpart, the '''Retro Leviathan''' excels at [[:Category:Capital Ship|capital ship]] combat.\
==Interior==\
The bridge is composed of a relatively simple room with windows in addition to a large pilot chair and two passenger seats, although only the former can be sat in. Before the bridge, there is a short hallway containing multiple seats and a teleporter to the bridge.\
==Advantages==\
* Has an overall large and balanced health pool, allowing the ship to take a considerable amount of damage before having to retreat.\
* Its large cargo hold allows for a substantial amount of loot to be stored; perfect for pirating and looting bosses.\
* Extremely high top speed and maneuverability for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]; has an exorbitant turn speed of '''0.9''', allowing it to outmaneuver other Capital ships with extreme ease.\
* Overall better stats and better firepower than the [[Leviathan]].\
* High hull damage output with its 4 [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Cannons]].\
* Large assortment of [[Turrets]] allows for versatility. \
==Disadvantages==\
* Very expensive for a Dreadnought.\
* Although it is hard to exploit due to the ship's very high turn speed, the underside is a weakspot.\
* Total health and overall damage output are on the lower end for a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
==Strategy==\
* Be very careful when using this ship, as it will be hunted due to its expense and Limited status.\
* Its weaponry and decent health pool allow it to chase down crippled ships very well.\
* Abuse large ships' blindspots with your extreme maneuverability.\
* In combat, warp and try to stay under your enemies; most of your turrets are on top of your ship.\
* Try to hit your [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] as they account for 1/3 of your hull DPS.\
\
==Version History==\
* Added in Version .66b for the Retro Ship Event.\
* Received a buff along with all other retro event ships in .66b shortly after the event ended.\
* Gained 2 Huge Cannons in version .75a5.\
*Explosion Size 180 ----> 940 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*The first player to lose this ship to another player was ''2_1q'' to ''AlikeBird''.\
*The first of the three leviathan models.\
*There is an admin ship that uses a downscaled version of this without the turrets, called the [[Baby Leviathan]].\

The '''''Blitz''''' is a powerful [[:Category:Fighters|'''Fighter''']] found in the [[Borealis]].\
\
==Description==\
The '''Blitz''' is a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] that spawns exclusively on the [[Borealis]]. \
==Appearance==\
The Blitz is a relative small and flat Fighter that has a spiky appearance, along with a large cannon on its side.\
==Advantages==\
*DPS of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.spinal_dps|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Blitz'}} and {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turret_dps|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Blitz'}} combined can lead to a monstrous DPS of 1080 when all fighters are used.\
*High speed.\
*Can cripple [[Ships]] as large as [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]] with multiple [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] alike.\
*Can drift at high speeds because of the 90% [[Strategies#Drifting|Drift Percentage]] for Fighter-class ships.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Low health.\
*Non-existent Damage Resistance of 0%.\
==Strategy==\
*This [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] is best used in a swarm. Attack the enemy with high speed and with its high shield damage, a swarm will bring enemy ships to [[Hull]] quickly.\
*Use this ship in a fleet because its high firepower can tear down [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]].\
*Utilize drifting and hit-and-run tactic to survive as long as possible while dealing the maximum amount of damage.\
*Avoid attacking any ship that can take down fighters easily, such as the [[Ampharos]] or the [[Mjolnheimr|Mjolheimr]].\
*Either keep your distance from your target at all times or make use of their blind spots.\
==Version History==\
* Shields reduced from 150 to 140, Hull reduced from 200 to 175, Top Speed reduced from 210 to 200, 3 [[Spinals|Small Phasers]] upsized to 2 [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Phasers]], 3 [[Spinal Weaponry|Small Cannons]] downsized to 3 [[Spinal Weaponry|Tiny Cannons]] and received a remodel in version .69e.\
* 2 [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Phasers]] downsized to 3 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] in an unknown version.\
*Interval for both spinals decreased (0.1 -> 0)  Health increased (250/250 -> 300/300) Explosion radius increased (1 -> 40) .75a12\
*Spinals nerfed and Blitz count increased from 6 to 12 in its Carrier the [[Borealis]] in version .75a37.\
==Trivia==\
*Added in version .61h\
*Added along with the [[Borealis]] as its [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Previously the only fighter to have [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Phasers]].\
*Looks somewhat similar to an old model of [[Lazarus]].\
*Due to the fact that the '''Blitz's''' model has almost no collision, it is possible for the player to fly into the interiors of [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]] or even other [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]], however doing this with the intention of destroying said Starbase or Carrier is a bannable offense.\

== Description ==\
The '''Retro Grievion''' is a limited model the [[Grievion]] that is an improved version of the original Grievion from Galaxy Alpha.\
\
It was only available for a limited time.\
==Interior==\
The interior is accessed through a transparent door leading into the ship from where it docks. There is a short hallway with two rooms on both sides of the hallway, leading to the bridge. The pilots seat is the first chair, in the center of the room towards the front facing a glass window. The other chairs in the room do not seem to be able to be sat in, and you can walk through them as if they don't exist. This problem is had by other retro ships at the moment, such as the [[Retro Hawklight]]. The two rooms branching from the hallway each have some beds, one has a fridge, and there are a few other various living appliances in them. Nothing in these rooms have any collision, like the chairs. the walls separating them from the hallway do not have collision either, and you may walk through them.\
\
==Advantages==\
* High maneuverability and speed for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
* Amazing [[Turrets|Turret]] and [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] firepower, considering retro Turrets do a lot more damage than normal ones.\
* High health.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
* Expensive.\
* Targeted because of its high value.\
* Mediocre acceleration for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
\
==Strategy==\
* Only use it if you're sure you won't lose it.\
* Stay near your [[Starbase]].\
* Make effective use of your [[Spinals]].\
\
==Version History==\
* Added in .66b, along with the [[:Category:Retro Ship Event 2019|Retro Ship Event 2019]].\
* Received a buff in .66b shortly after the event ended.\
*Spinal count decreased from 12/12 to 9/9, Retro Light Flak Cannon count reduced from 4 to 2 in version .73a3\

}}\
==Description==\
The '''X-0''' is an AI ship that has no weapons whatsoever but can call other pirates on the map to its location.\
\
It is a source of loot used in many powerful ships such as the [[Kraken]] or [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]].\
\
It has a random chance to spawn every 60 minutes in public servers, and has no player count requirement.\
\
'''X-0''' also resembles the old E Class freighter model.  \
== Loot ==\
*10 Plasma Batteries\
*650 [[Material Scrap]]\
*2 Data Archives (Chance)\
*2 Ascension Crystals (Chance)\
*2 Antimatter Shards (Chance)\
*150 Armor Scraps (Chance)\
==Strategy==\
*This ship is undefended on its own but can call pirates to its side for reinforcement.\
*Can be lured to a max level [[starbase]], but it will require the help of tanking and distracting to take it down, as a pirate fleet deals heavy damage with their spinals.\
*Take out any pirate support ships before facing it head-on.\
*Explosion size is around 4,000 studs. While not large and unlikely to cripple/destroy most ships, it is recommended to warp out.\
*Most dreadnoughts can make quick work of it, however, be aware of the pirate fleet, if any.\
*Be aware of how the X-0 is moving away or towards you. If it is destroyed while moving up or down, it can go outside the map and be unlootable. This can be fixed by going in the opposite direction. If it's going up, move downwards, and vice versa.\
*'''<u>May fall in the red zone and be un-lootable</u>'''. To circumvent this issue, lure it to your [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] as a faction's primary starbase is far from the top and bottom border, lessening the chances of X-0's wreck falling into one. \
== Behavior ==\
* Moves back and forth similar to other enemies, similar to how the Punisher moves. Also makes \"attack runs\" by moving towards the player.\
*Tends to warp away from enemies constantly, however, usually warps on a target later.\
* Calls other pirates to location if an enemy is present, which can include the [[Kodiak]] and/or [[Galleon]], which may also call the X-0 to their location.\
* Similar to all pirates, chases down (with other pirates) fleeing enemies.\
==Version History ==\
* Loot nerf: Armor scraps 200 -> 199 (.74b17)\
*Loot nerf: Armor scraps 199 -> 150 (Version needed)\
*Loot nerf: Plasma batteries 15 -> 10 (Version needed)\
==Trivia==\
*This ship appears to use the same AI as all other AI-class ships, as it will \"engage\" targets and move back and forth away and towards the target.\
*Uses the model of the [[D Class]], which was formerly the model of the [[E Class]].\
*Despite it being a [[Pirates|Pirate]] ship, the cargo containers on the X-0 are blue rather than brown or dark red that corresponds to the faction's color.\
*As of this edit, the damage resistance of X-0 is bugged and it has the same resistance as a Super Capital, which is 65%.\

== Description ==\
The '''Tango''' is a cheap [[:Category:Miner|Miner]]-class ship that is equipped with two [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]]. Its health totals at 1000 and is divided evenly between [[Hull]] and [[Shields]] (500/500). Its [[Turrets|Mining Lasers]] have a range of 4500 studs. Takes a minimum of 100 seconds to fill up its hold.\
== Appearance==\
The minuscule interior of the '''Tango''' consists of a dome that houses the cockpit. Assorted crates and a screen are spread in this cramped room.\

* Very low cost.\
* New players can use this to make a decent profit.\
* Good speed for a [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
* If used by a player with a level one [[warehouse]], it is immune to all damage.\
* Explosion Radius of 25\
*It can be obtained for free once with the [[Codes|code]] TANGO.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low health. (1000 total HP).\
* Somewhat slow mining speed.\
* Limited Cargo and Ore Hold.\
* Targeted by [[Pirating|Pirates]] due to the low health pool.\
==Strategy==\
* Make sure to check for any enemies every 30 seconds, either by looking around or on the [[Minimap]].\
* Always mine in a peaceful faction to ensure safety from players.\
* Always make sure your faction has strong allies.\
* Don't mine at the [[Mega Base]] during a [[War]].\
* When [[War]] is declared, quickly turn back to the closest base and despawn.\
=== Safety ===\
* Don't mine near [[Aliens]] or [[Pirates]], and dock if one starts coming closer.\
* Never mine at [[War]] unless your [[Warehouse]] is level one.\
* If [[Mining]] at [[War]], check the [[Minimap]] every 30 seconds; however, it can be very foolish to insist on mining during a [[War]].\
* If mining at war, stay close to your [[Starbase]] for protection.\
== Version History ==\
* Was given a remodel .56?\
* .61h1? - [[Warp Drive]] added.\
* Remodeled in version .73f8.\

* There is a type of dance (or dance style) the ship is named after; the [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango Tango].\
* Enter code \"tango\" to get a free '''Tango''' (the code will not work if you own a '''Tango''').\

== Description ==\
Despite it having a [[Spinals|Torpedo]], the '''Belvat''' is not well suited for sieges. Instead, it is a PvP ship focused on [[spinals|Spinal]] weapons. It also has unique bottom-mounted [[Turrets]] on its wings. The '''Belvat''' is a good hit and run ship against enemy [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], [[:Category:Miner|Miners]], some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]].\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Belvat's''' interior consists of a simple hallway behind the cockpit that acts as a teleporter and the cockpit itself. Inside the cockpit is a small neon display and a decorated pilot's seat.\
== Advantages<nowiki/> ==\
* It has high firepower from its [[Spinals|Phasers]] and [[Spinals|Torpedo]].\
* Good for taking out [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]], [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]], and [[Aliens|Swarmers]].\
* Well defended bottom.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Easily countered by itself with another Battlecruiser.\
* Vulnerable topside.\
* If you approach from above, all the [[Turrets]] can hit, but it also gives enemy ships an advantage since the majority of their weapons can likely fire upwards and hit you.\
* Slow [[Spinals|Torpedo]], making it ineffective against small ships or anything moving too quickly.\
* Hard to aim [[Spinals|Torpedoes]].\
* Low health.\
== Strategy ==\
* Some players prefer this over the [[Razor Wing]] due to it being less common and not well known. It can also support more roles than the [[Razor Wing]]. (i.e.: Siege)\
\
* Attack from above/below to try and get the jump on other Ships before they can realize where you are.\
* During a siege, use the [[Spinals|Torpedo]] against static or slow targets, like bases and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
== Version History ==\
* It used to use an odd wield script resulting in offset parts. It was later fixed in the Version .52 update.\
* Remodeled in the continuation of version .65b.\

\
==Description==\
The '''Pirated Grievion''' shares the same model as the original [[Grievion]], but is made almost entirely out of wood. It has actual pirate ship cannons lining the side, along with Flak Cannons, and has dark black side wings.\
\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Pirated Grievion''' is similar to the layout of the [[Grievion]], but is also made entirely out of wood. The cargo containers near the front are replaced with pirate treasure chests. It also contains an easter egg in one of the walls.\
\
==Advantages==\
* Much more health compared to its normal counterpart(the [[Grievion]]).\
* Much faster firing spinals compared to its normal counterpart.\
* Equipped with a near-unique set of pirate-themed turrets, giving this ship good turret firepower.\
\
==Disadvantages==\
* Limited event ship makes it a prime target for trophy hunters or pirates.\
* Expensive for its class.\
\
==Strategy==\
* Use this to pirate isolated Miners or Freighters, but be weary when doing so as you are an attention-grabbing target.\
\
==Version History==\
* Added in the [[Halloween Event 2018]]. (version .65a)\
* Received a remodel, health increased from 1,700/1,650 Shield/Hull HP to 3,100/2,900, turret loadout changed from 4 Light Flak Cannons, 2 Light Lasers, and 2 Medium Lasers to 5 Light Hijacked Gatling Cannons, 1 Pirated Heavy Laser, 1 Pirated Medium laser, and 1 Pirated Light Laser, Spinals changed from 6 Medium Cannons to 12 Small Cannons, Spinal firing interval adjusted to 0.05 seconds, Top Speed increased from 110 to 200, Acceleration increased from 10 to 25, and Turn Speed increased from 0.45 to 0.58 in version .75a5.\
\
==Trivia==\
* Like the original [[Grievion]], there's a hidden room in front of the lower room.\
* A photo of the [[Grievion]], the regular buildable counterpart to the '''Pirated Grievion''' is shown below.\
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a D class permit (675k credits) + 2367 Sillicate, 1781 Carbon, 1219 Iridium, 24 Adamantite, 106 Palladium, 36 Titanium, and 36 Quantium.\

== Description ==\
The '''Liberator''' is a unique Dreadnought with its own Patriotic [[Turrets]]. It stands out among its class as an extremely maneuverable ship with a slim design, though it comes at the cost of slightly mediocre health when taking into account its price. It has a long, tapered body with a \"patriotic\" red, white, and blue color scheme. The ship can be entered through a teleporter-door on one side, which also means it docks \"sideways.\" This ship was the only unique (non-reskin) ship added during the [[Fourth of July Event 2020]].\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Liberator''' is very simple: a metallic, blue box with the American flag, a seat, and a small teleporter pad.\
==Advantages==\
*High maneuverability.\
*Armed with unique [[Turrets]] that have high [[Hull]] damage.\
*[[Spinals]] have good [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
*Very fast, with an impressive top speed of 125.\
*Its slim design enhances its evasive abilities.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Was very expensive when it was onsale, requiring a level 28 [[Warehouse]].\
*Somewhat fragile for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] of its cost.\
*Requires [[Spinals|Spinal]] aiming in order to deal effective [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
*Very difficult to aim all [[turrets]] and spinals at the same time.\
*Despite being very mobile, its vulnerable underside leaves it prone to swarms.\
==Strategy==\
*Use this ship's extreme maneuverability to strafe and drift around enemy ships like you would in a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
*Avoid using this ship in dangerous situations, as it can't be rebuilt after the event ends.\
*Although this ship has Light Turrets, they are best used against larger ships rather than smaller ones.\
*Due to the lack of shield damage outside of spinals, this ship somewhat struggles at destroying smaller vessels with decent shields.\
==Version History==\
*[[Shields|Shield]] reduced to 2200 in version .68b, which caused a price drop.\
*[[Shields]] increased from 5800 to 6500, [[Hull]] increased from 3000 to 4000, [[Turrets|Turret]] placement changed and teleporter position changed in version .68b.\
*Hull increased from 4000 to 6500 and 2 [[Turrets|Patriotic Mass Drivers]] added in version .69e.\
*Speed decreased from 130 to 100 in an unknown version.\
*Explosion Size 160 ----> 820 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
*DrWhoInTARDIS was the first to lose this to Shadiris's [[Lucifer]].\
*Used to break all [[Turrets|Turret]] projectiles and sound effects.\
*Used to have 130 speed, which was the highest of any [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] at the time. \

The battle started when Kneall forces launched a surprise attack on an undisclosed fleet near Sector 552.

== Description ==\
The '''Reaper''' is a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] that you can get by completing the [[Halloween Quest]]. Previously, the '''Reaper''' had no weapons but it now has 2 [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]] and 12 assorted [[Spinals]]. In order to acquire the '''Reaper''', you would have to collect 5 [[Pumpkin|Space Pumpkins]] from a [[Grim Reaper]]. Once you had them you would turn them into the [[Headless Horseman]] to receive your prize.\
\
==Interior==\
The '''Reaper''' has a very simple interior. When docked, you step onto the top of a skull with a panel. Once you step on the panel, you will be taken to a small square room with the driver's seat and the panel back to the entry skull.\
\
== Advantages ==\
* Fast.\
* Surprisingly strong [[Spinals]].\
* Oddly enough, it's very hard to hit because of all the thin separate hitboxes.\
* Insane [[Shields]] and [[Hull]].\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Difficult to counter smaller ships, due to its lack of [[Turrets|Small Turrets]].\
* Very rare, and a Bounty Hunter's dream.\
* The center orb blocks your view occasionally, making the use of [[Spinals]] difficult at times.\
* Sometimes hard to aim due to the FOV being small.\
* Primary targeted in fleets.\
\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship can be used for [[Pirating]] large ships effectively, with its high Speed, great health, and [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]].\
* Avoid facing higher-class ships alone, as it can be lacking in firepower at times.\
* Only spawn to show off to other players.\
\
==Version History==\
* The '''Reaper''' started with 4000 Shield and 666 Hull, then was buffed to 6666 Shield and 6666 Hull. It was later nerfed to 3333 Shield and 3333 Hull, then buffed back to 6666 Shield and 6666 Hull. After another nerf to 3333 Shield and 3333 Hull, its health was buffed more modestly to 3999 Shields and 3333 Hull. (Exact versions unknown)\
* Max Hull increased from 3333 to 3999, Small Phasers upgraded to Medium Phasers, barrel count increased to 6, Turn rate increased to .55, received a partial remodel/visual updates in version .65b.\
*Interior issues were fixed in version .72c29.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* When it was first added into the game it had no weapons.\
* It's a weaker and smaller version of the [[Grim Reaper]].\
* Once you lose this ship, there's no way to get it back.\
* Rare to see in game due to the fact that some of the few that have gotten it have lost it trying to use it in combat.\
* It has the most health out of any [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] in game currently.\
* The ship now sells for more [[Credits]] than it did pre-buffs and no matter how tempting it may be to sell, you can't get the ship back.\

\
== Disadvantages ==\
* You will be targeted by those who see it as a prize kill.\
* No weapons.\
* One of the rarest ships in the game making it one of if not the largest target kill.\
*The raffle for it was on discord, meaning you had to be at-least 13 years old to obtain it because of the Discord Terms of Service.\
\
== Strategy ==\
* Be incredibly careful while using this, as it is non-refundable and you will <u>'''never'''</u> be able to obtain it again.\
* <u>'''Never'''</u> spawn it during a [[War]].\
* Only spawn to show off to people.\
\

* Interestingly enough, while the ship is the only raffle ship of its kind, along with the [[3D Printed Warlock|3d Printed warlock]], the [[Kapisi]], the [[Sakala]] and the [[Discordite Cluster|discordite cluster]], it is also dual-classified as a ''[[:Category:Limited|Limited Event ship]]'' and an ''[[:Category:Admin|'''Admin Ship''']]''.\
* One of the few limited event ships available for one day, including the [[Coal Wasp]], [[Festive Wasp]], the [[United States of Razor]], and the [[Festive Wyrm]].\
* One of the rarest ships in the game, as less than 15 people own this ship for certain, counting admins, devs and the lucky people.\
* On August 8, 2020, user JustKingRuslan lost his '''2018 Ship''' when user EvilPleeber119 dove his '''docked''' ship in an [[Astraeus]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Bone Ampharos''' is a limited edition version of the [[Ampharos]] released during the [[Halloween Event 2017]]. It costs double the amount of a normal [[Ampharos]]. Most see this ship as a collectible.\
\
The '''Bone Ampharos''' is a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] that consists of 2 heavy blast wings attached to the main body. It is great for defending heavy [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] ships during a siege along with defending a base against small [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] trying to distract the base's [[Turrets]].\
== Appearance ==\
Unlike the normal [[Ampharos]], the '''Bone Ampharos''' has little interior. On the back of the dragon's \"tail\" there is a teleporter which leads you to a small room inside the dragon's head. There is a pilot's seat in there made out of bones.\
== Advantages ==\
* Absolutely shreds small ships.\
\
* High mobility.\
\
* Decent [[Spinals]].\
\
* Extremely good at fleet support.\
* Pretty fast for a battleship its size.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Vulnerable bottom.\
* Not good against [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] or anything with high firepower.\
* Can't siege due to the lack of [[Turrets|Railguns]] and Heavy Weaponry.\
\
* Rare limited ship puts a huge target on your head.\
\
* You can't get it back if you lose it.\
*Somewhat low damage for a Battleship\
== Strategy ==\
* It's close-range rapid-fire armament makes it ideal for fighting small, fast ships.\
* Having multiple '''Bone Ampharos‘''' alongside [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] (above, sides, and bottom) can greatly help them out. Small [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] ships can easily outmaneuver siege ships and it is the [[Ampharos|Ampharos's]] job to keep them protected.\
* It is a good ship for pirating or escort, however, it is not as mobile as other combat ships such as [[Sixfold]] or [[Grievion]].\
* Don't try to hit and run a [[Starbase]], you'll do little damage and the [[Starbase]] will leave you with a practically destroyed ship.\
==Version History==\
* Shield and Hull increased from 3500/3500 to 3750/3750, Light Flak Cannons upgraded to Medium Flak Cannons in version .65b.\
*Explosion size 80 ----> 450 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* Only available during the [[Halloween Event 2017|Halloween 2017]] event.\
* Is known to some players as the \"Flying Skelly\".\
* It is the 3rd most expensive [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] in the game.\
* Was one of the Event ships that was put back on sale for the Black Friday sale.\
* Retains a previous ampharos model (but edited to fit the Halloween event theme).\

\
==Description==\
The '''Plagued Warship''' is a [[Halloween Event 2019]] Battleship. It is well-known for its extreme average damage output, being able to outdamage many [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]. \
== Appearance==\
The interior is a detailed box, with a nice seat and a display in front of it. The display says \"29~##024aA4 SYTEM STATUS: BETTER THAN EVER 0Km(4##_-pR\". \
==Advantages==\
*Insane overall damage output of 357; it has the highest average DPS out of all Battleships if not taking into account the [[Revylation 🦍|Revylation]] and [[Snowfall]], both being ships that cannot fully utilize their total DPS in most combat situations.\
*Great mobility statistics, with a fast turn speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turn_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = '{{PAGENAME}}'}}.\
*Fairly high total health pool.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Must be pointing the ship towards the enemy for all of the turrets to have a line of sight.\
*Has little long range weaponry.\
*Must have good spinal aim to use ship this effectively, as its spinals make up for almost half of its damage output.\
*It is a prime target due to its limited status and strength.\
*May struggle against smaller ships.\
==Strategy == \
*Use your [[Spinals]], as they provide massive output DPS and will obliterate the opponent's [[Shields]], then you can rely more on the [[Turrets]] and Cannons to finish the target off.\
*Get in the ship's weak spot and focus with [[Spinals]].\
==Version History== \
*Medium Cannon spinal barrel count increased from 4 to 5, Quad Advanced Medium Cannons' positions shifted such that the turrets are \"orbital\" in version .72d.\
*Explosion size 80 ----> 600 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*The first player to lose one was SCRAPPIE_1, destroyed by GrumpyMadPlayer's [[Atlas]].\
*It resembles the old [[Genesis]] model, and shares most attributes except for the \"tentacles,\" as well as the spinal weaponry, it also resembles the current [[Katana]] model.\
**It actually came out before the old [[Genesis]] model and the current [[Katana]] model.\
*It was the only [[:Category:Battleship|battleship]] introduced in the [[Halloween Event 2019]].\
*The total health of this ship is the same as [[Glacier]] but with the [[Shields]] and [[Hull]] reversed.\

==Description==\
The '''Prototype X/1''' is a miniature version of the [[Prototype X-1]] with much weaker stats but very high maneuverability. It uses the same model but otherwise behaves like a Battlecruiser with its decent DPS and size.\
==Interior==\
The interior matches the original Prototype X-1, with a miniature hallway leading up to a miniature pilot's seat that the player almost completely covers up while sitting on.\
\
[[File:X1_Interior.png|frameless]]\
==Advantages==\
* Very high speed and acceleration.\
*Excellent mobility and maneuverability.\
*Great hull breaker and DPS for a battlecruiser.\
* All turrets are able to be fired at once.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Low health, unable to face an [[Punisher|Alien Punisher]] head-on.\
*Large size and an easy target.\
*Whole armament is for hull damage, absolutely horrible at shield damage.\
*Slow acceleration and deceleration in comparison to its high speed.\
*Considered a very valuable target as it is one of the few ships with \"[[:Category:Prototype|Prototype]]\" in its name.\
*Low cargo hold.\
==Strategy==\
*This ship should never face anything more significant than a [[:Category:Battleship|battleship]] due to its low health, you should be aiming towards other [[:Category:Battlecruiser|battlecruisers]] and smaller ships, maybe even enemy [[:Category:Planets|planets]].\
*Using its high speed and agility, one should get into the blind spot of the enemy ship and use the hit and run strategy, where you shoot and you get out of its range.\
*This ship is off-sale and permanently unobtainable, so it should be kept as a trophy rather than a combat craft.\
==Version History==\
*Added in version .75\
*Removed from the game a couple of days later in .75\
*Converted into a battlecruiser and given a complete overhaul by developers.\
*Was completely removed from your inventory in version ('''<u>please add in</u>''')\
==Trivia==\
*On its first release, the ship was only available on the build menu for 10 minutes, making one of the most scarcely available ships in the game.\
*In its second and latest release, the '''Prototype X/1''' was available on the build menu for around 3 hours, still significantly limiting its availability.\
*The ship was scheduled to be deleted by the releaser [[Teentitansgohomee|Teentitans]] but this idea was scrapped and the ship is scheduled for a nerf instead.\
*The '''Prototype X/1''' was previously a frigate but converted into a battlecruiser for unknown reasons[[File:X1 Ambience.mp3|thumb|Scary ambience of the Prototype X/1|none]]\

== Description ==\
The '''Chimera''' is a [[Turrets|Turret]]-focused [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]]. Its description proclaims it as an old [[United Nations of Earth|U.N.E]] vessel. This ship makes up for its speed in with substantial [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Chimera''' is surprisingly good for its class. You enter using a metal door on the side of the ship and then there is a carpeted corridor going 2 ways. The left way goes into a metal room with a core and detailed status reader. The right way goes past 2 chairs and up a small ramp to a single seated glass cockpit. There is also a picture of the creator of the ship\
== Advantages ==\
* Extremely cheap.\
* Many [[Turrets]].\
* Great [[Turrets|Turret]] placement.\
* Good health.\
* Good cargo Hold for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
* No large blind spots.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Slow speed for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]].\
* Relatively large size means it can be hit easier.\
* Rear can be damaged by small [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*It's hard to use all turrets at once.\
== Strategy ==\
* Go into suicidal missions as it is very cheap to build. Use this to your advantage by fighting in it until it is destroyed. Once it has been destroyed, you can easily just buy another one.\
* Moving in large groups of '''Chimera''' can be an effective strategy.\
* Should be used as a supporting ship.\
* To ensure all turrets have a clear line of sight on targets, don't engage targets head on; instead engage in broadside combat with the side of your ship facing the enemy.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a buff in .65a4? that increased the '''Chimera's''' health by 300 (100 to shields and 200 to hull).\
* Buffed in version .66b - received another turret, had its light laser changed to a light gatling laser, and had its acceleration buffed from 10 to 35.\
== Trivia ==\
*Was the cheapest [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]], but got beaten by the [[Ibis]].\
*There is an identical door on the port side of the ship, though it is solid and does not lead anywhere.\
*It's one of the commonly used starter [[Ships|S]][[ships|hips]].\
*The engine piece on the back looks very similar to the engines on the [[Hasatan]].\
*The antenna array on the top is the same as the one on the [[Devestation]] and [[Hasatan]].\
*Sometimes good at defense, as its [[Turrets]] can cover all areas.\

The Aedes is a [[Halloween Event 2022]] Quest Battleship.\
==Description==\
The name of Aedes carries a lot of irony. For a ship named after what were considered pests in the early days of humanity, this ships arsenal excels in the destruction of any sub-capital ship. \
==Appearance==\
The Aedes is a long, mostly green, black and grey ship that has 2 short fins at the back, along with 8 pointy cylinders that glow a light green and may be thrusters. The engines, like the \"thrusters\" glow a light green and are split up into 9 sections. Most of your guns are located near the back as well on the top of the ship. The front portion of the ship curves and gets smaller, with details similar to the front of the ship, decorated in grey, scale like shapes and a green glowing spike at the very front of the ship, also where the spinals fire from. \
==Advantages== \
*Good against hull-based ships like the [[Armageddon]], due to the turrets being hull based.\
*Good health for a battleship.\
\
*Extremely fast for a battleship, coming in at 210 Studs Per Second.\
*High accuracy turrets, with most of them being flaks and lasers.\
*Good turn speed of 0.55, coming out on top against most other battleships.\
*Large cargo hold of 500. (When compared to other battleships)\
*Extremely long range of 8000 studs, meaning that you can pick of fighters from afar.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Requires good [[Spinals|spinal]] aim to deal sufficient damage to [[Shields|shield]].\
*Turrets are [[Hull]] based, making it harder to kill [[Shields|shield]]-based ships.\
*Your Aedes flak cannons do not do much damage, and your Spindle Lances have a long reload, making it hard to dish out a lot of damage on any targets with a decent amount of health.\
*Large blind spot at the bottom of the ship due to the absence of guns.\
==Strategy==\
*Due to the high speed and fast turn rate, use your high maneuverability to help destroy your opponents.\
*Most of your guns are on the top of the ship, with 1 on each side of the front/middle of the ship. This means you will have to position the ship much like you would when using a [[Judgement]], facing towards the enemies or right below them in order to fire all of your guns, including [[spinals]].\
*If you do end up having a person abusing your blind spot below you, quickly roll over or go below them using your quick speed.\
*The Aedes weaponry is heavily AA based, using highly accurate Flaks and Lasers, meaning that you can quickly melt smaller enemy ships such as fighters or frigates.\
==Trivia==\
*Shares the model with the [[An̶͋̈́a̶̍̆t̵̀̏h̷͓̚e̵̩͒m̷͗͊a̴̬͗]], the Aedes being the player ownable version.\

The '''''Valiant''''' is a balanced [[:Category:Battlecruiser|'''Battlecruiser''']].\
== Description ==\
The Valiant is a powerful [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] that deals massive damage with its [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]]. It has a white trail.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the Valiant is accessed by a teleport pad in the top middle of the ship. It then has a short walkway to the pilot seat, with a miniature control panel and a windshield. Both the windshield and the color scheme inside depends on the color of the team.\
== Advantages ==\
* Decent speed for a Battlecruiser.\
* Overall good damage output.\
* Great versatility, having the ability to cover many roles such as PvP, support, and so on.\
* Small and durable, a rare combo for Battlecruisers.\
* Great stopping power against similarly sized ships.\
* High turn speed and small size make it very hard to hug the vulnerable bottom.\
* Cheap.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* You have to be able to aim [[Spinals]] in order to deal enough damage to defeat your enemies.\
* Vulnerable rear, though this may not be a problem due to its turn speed.\
* People can easily get out of your spinal zone and you will lose a lot of potential damage.\
* You have to be in a precise angle to use all of your [[Turrets]].\
== Strategy ==\
* Keep people in your aim, and try and get in their blind spot.\
* Use the spinals to dish out damage.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .65a6.\
* Top speed increased to 130, turn speed increased to 0.59, acceleration increased to 29, lost 2 [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannons]] and received a remodel in version .68e.\
*Turret loadout changed to 2 [[Turrets|Lykos Defense Lasers]] and 1 [[Turrets|Lykos Defense Cannon]] in version .72c20.\
*Shields and Hull buffed from 1450 to 1500 and 1250 to 1300 respectively, as well as gaining a 3rd Medium Phaser and another Lykos Defense Cannon in version .72d\
== Trivia ==\
* The original model was based on the [[w:c:expanse:Rocinante (TV)|Rocinante]] from the TV show The Expanse.\
* Was previously broken due to mesh displacement.\
* Not possible to walk from the end of the terminal dock to the back of the ship, as half your body will be impaled in the ship, resulting in you falling off. The best option is to either use the teleport menu or jump right onto the teleporter.\

==Description==\
This limited ship is one of the first models of the widely loved [[Hawklight]]. It features a weapon loadout similar to the original's and proves to be a very strong PVP ship just like its normal counterpart.\
==Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Retro Hawklight''' is rather mundane; it is composed of a single room with the pilot seat at the front and a very similar looking seat in addition to a blank screen at the back right corner of the area.\
== Advantages==\
* Powerful hull breaking [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]].\
*Great top speed and maneuverability; higher turn speed and acceleration than even the [[Sentaliz]].\
*Balanced and high health pool for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Versatile [[Turrets]] are able to provide some protection against smaller ships while still doing a good amount of damage, especially towards [[Shields]].\
*Damage output is much more balanced compared to its regular counterpart.\
*Due to its speed, agility and high DPS, it is a great ship for [[Pirating]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*Relies heavily on its spinals for hull damage.\
* Expensive for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* The underside is a weakspot; only 1 Turret is positioned under the ship.\
\
* Slightly problematic turret placement.\
==Strategy==\
*Warp under your opponents as almost all of the turrets are on top of the ship.\
*Exploit bigger ships' blindspots with your superior mobility.\
*Use this ship's [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] to finish off crippled targets.\
*Be careful when using this ship as it will be seen as a valuable target. Avoid extensively tanking damage and retreat if needed.\
==Version History ==\
*Added in .66b, along with the [[:Category: Retro Ship Event 2019|Retro Ship event]].\
*Received a buff along with all other retro event ships in .66b shortly after the event ended.\
*2 Light Retro Flak Cannons replaced with 2 Retro Medium Lasers, spinal interval reduced to zero in version .72f\
*Health increased from 4050/3550 to 4550/3990 in version .73b3.\
*Hull increased from 3990 to 4300 in an unknown version.\
*Explosion size 45 ----> 480 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*The first person to lose this ship was StarWarsFany to a [[Starbase]].\
*The ship's model isn't the original model. Instead, it is the second model because of the original model being a free model.\
*<span>Was one of the event ships that was put back on sale for the [[:Category:Black Friday 2019|Black Friday sale]].</span>\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Legionnaire''' is a speedy assault [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] that excels at supporting larger [[Ships]] during battles. Though it's nothing like the in-game concept of a destroyer, It very closely resembles a real life [[wikipedia:Destroyer#:~:text=In naval terminology, a destroyer,against powerful short range attackers.|Destroyer]], and is played like one too. It has very powerful [[Spinals]] that allows it to wear down shield quickly and is very maneuverable. The front hooded [[Spinals|Spinal]] system is unique compared to other [[Ships]].\
== Appearance ==\
You enter the interior by using a bridge on the right side of the ship that leads to two rooms. The first is empty apart from the doors to the bridge and other room. The second room has the pilot's seat in it.\
== Advantages ==\
* Incredibly good hull damage.\
* High [[Spinals|Spinal]] damage.\
* Phaser [[Spinals]] fire all at once, instead of one after another.\
* Variety of [[Turrets]] allows it to take on small and large [[Ships]] alike.\
* One of the fastest Battleships in the Game\
* Rather small for a Battleship, making it hard to hit.\
* Very high maneuverability for a ship of its class.\
* Very cheap for a battleship, being the 3rd cheapest, with the [[Prowler]] and [[Warden]] being cheaper than it.\
* Balanced DPS.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Exposed rear of the ship.\
* Low health for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Cannon Spinals fire one after the other, there is quite a long time in between shots, unlike it's Phasers.\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship isn't that great at holding its own in a fight against bigger [[Ships]], so try and accompany larger [[Ships]] like [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] into battle to help them destroy the enemy.\
*This ship is somewhat of a [[Archetypes|Glass-Cannon]], so dish out damage while remaining safe.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a slight buff in version .63h.\
* Heavy Cannon changed to a Triple Heavy Cannon in .65b.\
* In .66b its was buffed, having its shields go from 2750 to 2925 and its hull from 2000 to 2350. Its speed was also buffed from 100 to 120 and its turnspeed from 0.35 to 0.45.\
*Explosion size 50 ----> 280 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* Has a very unique [[Spinals|Spinal]] system.\

__NOTOC__\
== Description ==\
A [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] class ship created by [[Xeiron Industries]] and later updated by [[Event Horizon]], the '''Tennhausen''' is a highly versatile ship in the sense that its loadout allows it to perform well against many different opponents. It has powerful [[Spinals]] to kill capital ships and three Large Phasers that allow it to participate in PVP.\
== Appearance ==\
The ship's interior consists of a simply designed room with a teleporter.\
== Advantages ==\
* Good [[Spinals]].\
* Fast [[Spinals|Spinal]] reload.\
* Balanced [[Turrets|Turret]] damage.\
* Amazing firing-arcs.\
* More HP than Ridgebreaker\
* One of the cheapest Dreadnoughts on sale.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Unable to fight smaller [[ships]].\
* Massive blind spot at the underbelly of the ship.\
* Low turnspeed & speed.\
* Can't tank as much as other dreads\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship's strength lies in its ability to easily adapt to any new variables in a situation and its ability to tank a significant amount of damage which makes it ideal for defensive purposes.\
* It is a good ship for defending bases as its [[Spinals]] give it a long range, (allowing it to stay in range of base defenses and engage opponents) and it has a lot of health allowing it to survive the combined firepower of a [[Sieging|Siege]] fleet.\
* Stay under your opponent or base so all turrets can fire\
* Warp a bit if your opponent gets under you or go on the bottom on the map\
== Version History ==\
* Remodel by oChaosWarrioro added in .60d.\
*Its [[Turrets|Medium Cannons]] were switched to [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] and 2 of its [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]] were switched to [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] in version .63h.\
*2 [[Turrets|Heavy Railguns]] and 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] changed to 4 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] in version .69a1.\
*Model reverted in an unknown version (2021)\
*Explosion Size 150 ----> 615 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*The original model of this was going to be a Titan but the shipmaster heroXfight made it a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] instead.\
*The '''Tennhausen''' has received possibly the most number of remodels of any [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
*The '''Tennhausen''' and an old model is based on a ship of the same name in Rebel Galaxy.\
*In Rebel Galaxy, it is a Frigate class ship.\
*Once had an alpha turret on the top side. Most likely was a mistake or used as a placeholder\

The '''Frozen MLRS '''is a redesign of the [[MLRS]]. It was released December 20, 2018, when the [[Christmas Event 2018]] update came out. It was obtained as a quest reward from \"[[Gámér Gamer]]\" on [[Aqueous II]].\
== Appearance ==\
The ship's interior consists of a single seat and some holograms in the middle of a glass dome.0\
== Advantages ==\
* Great health for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
* Has a good arsenal of [[Turrets]] for its class.\
* Large Cargo Hold for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
* Can be used to siege [[Starbase]]s from afar.\
* Extremely powerful [[Spinals]].\
* Very high alpha damage for its class.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Required 25 [[Snowflake]]s.\
== Strategy ==\
*Use its [[Spinals|Large Torpedoes]] and perfect timing to heavily damage certain targets at all times.\
*Just like its normal counterpart, the [[MLRS]], it's useful in sieges with other siege ships such as the [[Ridgebreaker]].\
*Use your [[Turrets|Light Turrets]] to defend yourself from small ships.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .65b.\
* [[Spinals|Torpedo]] sizes increased to [[Spinals|Medium Torpedoes]] later in .65b.\
* [[Spinals|Torpedo]] sizes were increased again, from [[Spinals|Medium Torpedoes]] to [[Spinals|Large Torpedoes]] in .65b. The total health was also increased by 50 [[Shields]] and 5 [[Hull]].\
* Received a small colorization remodeling; instead of a rusty, frozen-over siege ship, it features a hi-tech design, perhaps due to the buffs it has received.\
*Turret loadout changed from 4 Light Lasers, 2 Light Flak Cannons to 4 Sickles, 2 Splitters, added trails in version .73a3\
*Renamed from Frozen MRLS Launcher to Frozen MLRS in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* Added for the [[Christmas Event 2018]].\
* Considerably viewed on par with some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] for sieging power and combat prowess.\
* When you turn in the materials and [[Credits]] needed to obtain the '''Frozen MLRS''', you may notice that 75k [[Credits]] were not given to the [[:Category:NPC|NPC]] contrary to the quest's requirements. This was not a result of a bug or glitch, but was scrapped by ARiNA last minute, according to a DM response on Discord.\
* If you were to kill this when the player has 0 [[Bounty]], you'd gain approximately 15k [[Bounty]].\
* The second ship that required additional [[Ores|Uranium]] to be exchanged in order to earn the ship.\
* Prior to the remodel, the '''Frozen MRLS '''looked like this: [[File:Frozen MRLS Launcher.jpg|thumb|220x220px|The Old Frozen MRLS Launcher.]]\

The '''''Aberrant''''' is a [[:Category:Dreadnought|'''Dreadnought''']] that is part of the [[Halloween Event 2019]].\
\
==Description==\
The '''Aberrant''' is a Limited [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] featuring in the [[Halloween Event 2019]], It is the first ship ever to have [[Turrets|Bio Accelerator Turrets]], which makes this ship unique. It is also the cheapest Dreadnought of the Event.\
==Interior==\
The interior consists of a small corridor with a teleporter you enter in, then at the end is a seat with a head piece, this seat controls the ship. The whole interior is made with green neon and black.\
==Advantages==\
*High damage to both [[Shields]] and [[Hull]], this being thanks to its 10 [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Phasers]], 3 Heavy Bio-Accelerators and 3 Bio-Accelerators.\
*High shield health and decent hull health.\
*Decent mobility for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*Shield damage depends almost entirely on the Phasers.\
*Will be hunted, due to it being a limited ship.\
*Hard to concentrate all Turrets on the same target due to their placement.\
*Has an unusually large hitbox, making it easier to hit with Turrets and Spinals.\
==Strategy==\
* Use the [[Spinals]] to shred the [[Shields]] of a ship, then let the Bio-Accelerator [[Turrets]] do the rest of [[Hull]] damage.\
* Avoid smaller [[Ships]], as your Turrets are not accurate enough to hit them.\
* Use sparingly, as it is costly and will become unobtainable after the event.\
==Version History==\
* Heavy Bio-Accelerators fixed in .66b to fire correctly.\
* Hull increased from 4250 to 5250 in version .66b.\
* Bio-Accelerator positioning fix, Heavy/Normal Bio-accelerator hull damage buffed, Reload decreased on Bio-Accelerators.\
*Hull increased from 5250 to 7250 in version .69a2.\
*Gained two tiny torpedoes in version .72d4.\
*Tiny torpedo count increased from 2 to 4 in version .73a3.\
*Moved teleporter behind the engines for easier access .75a12\
*Explosion Size 1000 ----> 910 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*The first person to lose an '''Aberrant''' was P0TAto_NooB to jay4444444444's [[Lucifer]].\
*Resembles the Undine Nicor Bio-Warship from Star Trek, but coloured differently\
*When initially added, the '''Aberrant''' had several issues involving Turrets, such as the Heavy Bio-Accelerators passing through Ships, line of sight issues, and Turrets pointing away from the target, this was later fixed.\
*The Turrets for the '''Aberrant''' have a custom, unique sound.\
*It has one of the most unique descriptions, in that the ship itself is contacting you.\
*According to the weapon's name of this ship (Bioaccelerators), the green color of the ship is understandable.\

== Description ==\
The '''Ghoul Nyx''' is the reskinned version of the [[Nyx]] made for the [[Halloween Event 2017]], and carries 10 [[Spirit]]s. It uses the original model of the Nyx with a different color scheme.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Ghoul Nyx '''is the same as the original Nyx model: very empty apart from the pilot's seat and hangar.\
== Advantages ==\
* [[Spirit]]s have high firepower.\
* Monstrous total health of 30000 is only lower than the [[Prototype X-1]] and [[Prototype X-2]].\
* High [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] count allows swarming of large ships.\
* Extremely high mobility for a ship of its size.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Colossal explosion size puts everyone in danger of taking heavy damage or having nearby ships and bases destroyed.\
* Can easily be destroyed by multiple [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] if undefended.\
* Demands cooperation in order for a proper combat scenario to be effective.\
* A huge target for [[Pirates]].\
* Was super expensive at the time, at a whopping $567,356 credits ($1,567,094.8 credits if you need to upgrade your warehouse).\
* Required a level 27 [[Warehouse]].\
* [[Turrets]] have low damage output.\
* Mediocre Cargo Hold.\
== Strategy ==\
* Always travel in a fleet to ensure maximum effectiveness.\
* Bait and Switch; warp into a dangerous zone, deploy the [[Spirit]]s and then warp out of the zone leaving the Spirits to deal with whatever you wanted dealt with.\
* When at war with multiple factions, they will almost always gather a fleet with the purpose of defeating it. Never rely on the Ghoul Nyx's health to tank a fleet.\
== Version History ==\
* Received some buffs in .60d that boosted Shields by 375 and Hull by 400.\
* Received a few buffs in .64c that (probably) gave the '''Ghoul Nyx''' turrets and more health.\
* Shield increased from 14000 to 15000 in version .68d.\
*Top speed increased from 35 to 50 in version .70c, along with every other ship that has a top speed of lower than 50.\
*Health increased from 15k/14k to 16k/14.5k, interior re-added in version .73b3\
== Trivia ==\
* This ship was the most expensive [[Ships|Ship]] in the game, up until the release of the [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]], and then the [[Osiris]], and then Super Capitals.\
* Can go months at a time without being spawned.\
* The largest [[Halloween Event 2017]] ship that was available.\
* There is a decal in the cockpit that states: GET OUT #Y#O#U#W#I#L#L#P#A#Y.\
* Has specialized [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]], those being the Spirits.\
* One of the Event Ships that was brought back for the [[:Category:Black Friday 2019|2019 Black Friday]] sale.\

}}\
==Description==\
The '''''Devastator''''' is a [[Starbase]] affiliated with the [[Aliens|Kneall]] added in the [[Kneall Event]]. It is the strongest [[Starbase]] to date, formerly [[Mothership]]. It has a total of 65,000 health. Taking it head on is a guaranteed death sentence as it's overwhelming turret firepower '''will''' gun you down no matter if you're a Small [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] or a large Capital ship and it regularly spawns large alien fleets, making it risky to siege the base unless you have an powerful siege fleet with multiple [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] and/or [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]].\
\
The Devastator can spawn in Private servers with a minimum player count of only 1, though it is much more difficult to destroy as [[United Nations of Earth|U.N.E]] fleets don't spawn in private servers.\
\
It has a <u>'''massive explosion size'''</u> of '''40k+ Studs''', rivalling that of [[Mothership]] and [[Mega Base]], and has destroyed numerous extremely expensive ships like an [[Azreal]] or a [[Lucifer]].\
\
It's wreck drops the materials needed to build the [[Annihilator]].\
\
== Strategy ==\
There has been a recording of a multiboxing strategy. It is blunt, but effective. (It is also costly):\
\
it requires:\
\
1 Nimitz, Prototype X-1, and a Prototype X-2. (The Nimitz must have all AI fighters, too.)\
\
by simply launching all fighters, and letting the X-1 and X-2 camp behind it, it can successfully kill a devastator. (Nimitz stays out of range)\
\
\
As of the 3rd of June, Devastator had been heavily nerfed. Its DPS is nerfed to that of a level 3 Myriad (still a lot, but way easier to kill without the help of UNE). It is quite possible to kill a devastator with 2 Nyx or 2 Annihilators in a private server.\
\
With Annihilator, warp into the range of the Devastator (preferably around 4.6k) and then release fighters. Tank for the fighters for as long as possible, run when you drop to around 6k to 5k shield. If your base is close enough, you may send fighters in while you're repairing. It is also advised that you warp directly behind devastator and release your fighters there, as both you and your fighters will be able to tank for longer.\
\
For Nyx, dump the fighters at 10k range then go back to base. Respawn and repeat once all fighters have died.\
\
It is advised to kill off the aliens around the Devastator before you head in using your carriers. The easiest way to do so is to lure a punisher/bionicle to your base.\
== Trivia ==\
* A smaller, heavily nerfed version of this Ship/Starbase exists and is called the [[Annihilator]]\
\
* '''NEVER''' use any ship that you cannot afford to lose against the Devastator. As of right now, there is no player obtainable ship (including Prototypes, confirmed by an admin) that can survive the Devastator nuke. And the nuke is very fast, you only have slightly more than 20 seconds to run from certain death.\
*It is, without a doubt, the strongest naturally spawning AI Base in the game.\
*The Eradicator is still stronger than the Devastator in a 1v1.\
*Its total turret count is somewhere over ''33, LITERALLY ALOT''\
*When Devastator first got released, it dropped around 2 million credits worth of loot. However, the amount of loot it drops had since been cut to a quarter (500k credits) and then halved again (250k credits). It is no longer worth it to farm Devastator over other money making methods with the latest loot nerf unless you can achieve maximum efficiency by bringing Super Capital alts.\

== Description ==\
The Reaver is a light, cheap, and reliable [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser Class]] ship. It has two light flak turrets, two light lasers, and two small cannons. It is very nimble and has good maneuverability. It is also partly known for its luxurious interior. Its cost makes it very disposable for established players and easily accessible for newer players as well.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior starts with an airlock room with its power reactor on the right wall. Past that is a hallway with two pieces of artwork on the left, the Frion artwork and Reaver blueprints, with a table on the right with a phone on top of it which displays the [https://discord.robloxgalaxy.wiki/|Galaxy Discord] server with two chairs on either side of the table. Past that is a counter on the right with a coffee maker and a sink. On the opposite side of the counter is a bed with a floating teal screen and shelving of more artwork above it and past that is a computer on the left and a refrigerator on the right. Into the next room is the cockpit containing the pilot seat and a detailed display.\
\
The text found above the refrigerator originates from [https://discord.com/channels/204965774618656769/350873216291700739/440041766373163008 this message] on the Discord server. It states “Reaver attacc, Reaver protecc, but most importantly... it provides snacc.”\
== Advantages ==\
* Very high maneuverability and good speed.\
* Good turret layout, great for attacking all kinds of ships.\
* Great damage for the price.\
* Affordable price.\
* Very high acceleration.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Rather low health, this ship can't take much punishment.\
* Heavily relies on [[Spinal Weaponry]] to deal considerable damage.\
* Harder to finish hull, as there are two more small Phasers than Cannons.\
== Strategy ==\
* Great as a cheap support craft, though if you're looking for firepower there are other better ships, such as the [[Aura]] or [[Guillotine]].\
* It fares decently against one or two [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] but be careful with them as a group of them can take you down if you don't warp away.\
* Drift around targets to hit your spinals while still dodging incoming fire.\
* Only fight bigger ships if they are slow with inaccurate turrets or have a blind spot for you to exploit.\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled in .64f (original version shown below).\
* Received four Small Phasers (\"G\" Spinal) in version .65b.\
== Trivia ==\
* The original description refers to it as a [[Hawklight|Mini-Hawklight,]] even though it's two classes lower.\
*\"Also known as a mini-hawklight, this ship can get to the battle quickly and turn the outcome of battle.\"\
* Certain players refer to it as the \"Reav\".\

== Description ==\
The '''Blackgate''' is a powerful [[:Category:Limited|Event Dreadnought]] with extremely high health and damage per [[Turrets|Turret]] volley. It has a similar design to the [[Cyber Leviathan]] and [[Prototype X-1]], with two large thruster-wing hybrid structures on either side of a thinner main body. The ship is largely black and grey in color, with some red highlights around certain central features. Its turrets are mounted along the top, front, and center of the ship and are rather hard to pick out against the similarly colored background.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Blackgate''' has a very detailed interior with two floors and a futuristic motif. Multiple seats and monitors are lined up on the upper floor before a set of staircases leads down to the lower floor on which lies a 3d hologram of the entire ship. \
== Advantages ==\
* Extremely high health for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] with a total of 17500 health points, making it very good for tanking damage.\
*Good mobility for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
*Despite having unbalanced health, it still has good shield health.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Blind spot at the rear of the ship.\
* If you lose it, you cannot get it back.\
*Overall relatively low damage output for an [[:Category:Limited|Event Dreadnought]]. [[Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought.]]\
* 3rd most expensive [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] in the game, costing at least $1,342,000 credits including the pumpkins.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use this ship if you're confident that it wont die.\
* Use this ship against Shield-based ships.\
* Make sure to check the map/leaderboard once in awhile to prevent losing your ship to a raid.\
== Version History ==\
* Hull reduced from 12,500 to 12,000 in version .69c\
* Added a spawn sound in version .69d.\
*Explosion Size 500 ----> 990 .75a12\
*Buffed health increase (8300/13200) -> (9000/13500) Distorienter Range increased (6650 -> 7500) Distorienter Tracking Acc. increased (4050 -> 12000) Telepathy Range increased (6858 -> 8000) Telepathy Tracking Acc. increased (2187 -> 9000) .75a27\

==Description==\
The '''Devastation''' is a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] with emphasis on support.\
==Appearance==\
Devastation is a long grey [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] that has an enlarged section in the front and four backside thrusters on the back. There is an flag with a bird on each side of the ship. \
\
The <u>'''Interior'''</u> can be accessed by walking through the door, there is a chair that sits in front of a screen. On the left, there is an anime profile picture, possibly of Wiscyy, the creator of the ship. \
\
Currently the model is slightly broken, with some parts being [[Galaxy Slang|Partshifted]].\
==Advantages==\
*Great [[Turrets|Turret]] placement, and range.\
*Very high cargo hold for a Battlecruiser.\
*2nd Highest health of all non-event [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]].\
== Disadvantages==\
*Incredibly sluggish maneuverability for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
*Long reloads due to the lack of rapid-fire turrets.\
*Very poor damage output for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]], being worse than several [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]] due to the poor turret armament and weak [[Spinal Weaponry]].\
*Very weak against small [[ships]], even worse when against large numbers.\
*Retired ship, making it limited and a huge target.\
==Strategy==\
*Keep the enemy in front to make use of the [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]].\
*Support sieges and fleets.\
*Use [[Spinals]] for extra shield damage.\
*Best used against other [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] and/or larger ships as the [[Turrets|Heavy Turrets]] struggle to hit smaller ships, though larger Cruisers like the [[Gryphon]] and [[Spectre]] are an exception depending on the range.\
==Version History==\
*Name fixed in .69d.\
*1 [[Turrets|Heavy Cannon]] replaced with 1 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannon]] in version .71b.\
*Made offsale and archived in .75a12 due to numerous problems such as partshift.\
== Trivia==\
*This ship's name used to be misspelled; it used to be '<nowiki/>'''Devestation'''<nowiki/>', rather than ''''Devastation'''<nowiki/>', as it is now. rcouret added a system to rename ships in version .69d.\
* On the wall next to the pilot's seat is a pinned image of the ship's creator.\
*Had the highest cargo hold of all [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] until the [[Zhen]] was introduced.\
*Has the same antenna array as the [[Hasatan]] and [[Chimera]], since they're all made by the same creator.\
* The emblem on the side is that of the Commonwealth of Man from Stellaris.\
* The ship has been retired.\

The '''Nisos''' is a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] that mostly does a lot of [[hull]] damage with its turrets. It also has [[Spinals]] that can do a lot of damage to the [[shields]]. It is pretty fast for its class. It was also the first ship to have a [[Turrets|Heavy Cannon]] as a [[Turrets|Turret]].\
== Appearance ==\
You walk onto a teleporter, which leads to a small room with a desk, a chair, 3 screens, a picture of [[Galaxy Staff|SuperChip15]], and a model of an Alien [[Swarmer]].\
== Advantages ==\
* Good speed, acceleration and maneuverability for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* Has both shield and hull-damaging weapons.\
* Cheap cost compared to most [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
* Good health pool.\
* Despite the vulnerable backside, it is a very small blind spot.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low amounts of shield-damaging [[Turrets]].\
* Large target, easy to hit with [[Spinals]].\
* Slightly lacking in health for its class.\
*Vulnerable underside.\
== Strategy ==\
* Excellent team PvP choice.\
* Remember to back down and retreat if you encounter a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dread]] or [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] mostly based on the shield.\
* Unless you are with a shield shredding ship, you must be good at using [[Spinals]].\
== Version History ==\
* 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Power Defense Lasers]] were changed to 2 [[Turrets|Super Power Defense Lasers]] in version .75a3. \
*Remodeled in an unknown version.\
* Buffed in .66b, having its shields go from 2400 to 2750 and its hull from 2700 to 3000. It's two Light Lasers were replaced with two Medium Lasers and its Light Flak Cannon was replaced with a Medium Flak Cannon.\
*1 [[Turrets|Medium Railgun]], 2 [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]], 1 [[Turrets|Heavy Cannon]] and 1 [[Turrets|Heavy Railgun]] replaced with 1 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Laser]], 1 [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannon]] and 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]], 3 [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Phasers]] changed to 6 [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Phasers]] and received a remodel in version .70a.\
*Explosion Size 80 ----> 290 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The previous '''Nisos''' model was based off a ship from the game [http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/Ship_Comparison Faster Than Light]. Said ship is also known as the Federation Cruiser B.\
* It is also one of the least-known ships in the game, with most players unaware of its existence.\
* Used to be a shield-breaker, but the [[Turrets]] were switched for the anti-hull variants.\
* The current model was originally meant to be a [[Warlock]] remodel. Which explains the similiarities between them.\
*Has unique [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] sound effects.\

== Description ==\
The Onslaught is a battleship that can be bought for 200k Credits from [[Rev]] on top of the Portal on the Kneall Portal Base. \
== Appearance ==\
The ship is a bright yellow and white playable version of the [[Alien Punisher]]. There is no interior. There is only a seat below the big bulb.\
== Advantages ==\
* Large Cargo Hold for a battleship.\
* Custom rapid firing and long-range laser and railgun [[turrets]] gives this ship the highest turret-based damage output of any battleship.\
* High speed and maneuverability for a [[:Category:Battleship|battleship]].\
* Small frontal and rear profile means that any inaccurate armament will have a difficult time hitting the ship, as long as it is pointed towards or away from the attacker.\
* Decently balanced health pool of 9,000 HP.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Limited classification means this ship will be targeted often by other players or pirates seeking to destroy high-value ships.\
* Requires pointing directly at your target for all turrets to have a good line of sight.\
* Costed 200,000 credits, which is expensive (for a battleship); but not as expensive as many other [[:Category:Limited|limited]] battleships or [[:Category:Advanced Ship|advanced]] battleships.\
== Strategy ==\
* Support a fleet in [[Sieging]] a [[Starbase]] by utilizing the long range on your turrets, which is enough to keep you out of range of short-ranged weaponry or AA defenses.\
* Chase down and destroy crippled [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreadnoughts]], that in most cases lack the accurate armament necessary to fend you off.\
* Do not use this ship alone. It may be strong, but like the [[Nautilus]]; you currently cannot obtain it again should you lose it to destruction.\
* Use the lasers to harass smaller or faster ships (like the [[Constantine]]), as they are fairly accurate for the amount of damage they output.\
== Version History ==\
* Implemented in version .75a<sup>(which patch number of .75a?)</sup>.\
* Model updated .75a12\
*4 Salavaged Multilaser turrets changed to 8 Salvaged Lasers and 2 Salvaged Railguns .75a12\
*Spinals (4 Large Cannons) removed .75a12\
*Turrets nerfed (4.8k range, less accuracy) .75a12\
*Speed 145 ----> 110 .75a12\
*Explosion size 200 ----> 420 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* Within the first 24 hours of its release, 5 people had lost the '''Onslaught''', those people being poopbudy200, luhmeka, Luigi_isawsome, kaleb2056, and universalboy180.\
\
* The first person to destroy another ship with the '''Onslaught''' was Quanterox, claiming poopbudy200's '''Onslaught'''.\
* The quest to obtain the Onslaught was originally only available for completion once.\

== Appearance ==\
The interior is a small black box with several chairs, one being the pilot chair. There are also several icicles hanging down from the ceiling.\
== Advantages ==\
* Powerful high accuracy [[Turrets]] allow it to fight ships of all sizes.\
* High health allows it to take a beating from enemy ships.\
* Has 4 [[Frostfire]]s for [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] that rival the [[Zhen]], making them powerful for [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters.]]\
* Has very high firepower for a carrier, allowing it to destroy other large [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]] without the assistance of its fighters.\
*Relatively cheap to equip all it's fighters with AI pilots, only costing 1000 robux without VIP.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Expensive for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]], at a whopping $1,073,519 credits ($3,003,500 credits if you upgrade the warehouse from level 1 to level 33)\
* Is a [[:Category:Limited|Limited Ship,]] so it will make you a larger target.\
* Required a level 29 [[Warehouse]] to build when it was onsale.\
==Version History==\
* Health increased from 7500/7500 to 11000/8500 and [[Turrets|Medium Point Defense Lasers]] changed to [[Turrets|Heavy]] variants in version .68d.\
* Health decreased back to 7500/7500 in version ???\
* Health increased from 7500/7500 to 11500/10500, Heavy Flak Cannons and Heavy Point Defense Lasers upgraded to their respective \"Super\" variants in version .73c10\
*Added 2 more [[Frostfire]] fighters.\
*Frostfire torpedo size downgraded from medium to small in version ???\
== Trivia ==\
*Most expensive ship in the first stage of the [[Christmas Event 2019]], and it is also the second most expensive of all [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]], The first one being the [[Annihilator]].\
*The first player to lose this ship was CVN83, after he lost connection next to a Level 4 [[Starbase]]. He escaped the base with just 31 [[Hull]] only to be killed moments later by DJFancehFeast's [[Zhen]].\
*The most sought after ship of the event.\
*The design of the '''Hailstorm''' can be seen as an unintentional hybrid of multiple ships. The exterior looks to be a fusion between the remodeled [[Cyclops]] and [[Tempest]] Dreadnoughts. The '''Hailstorm''' also operates like the [[Icarus]] carrier bringing 4 unique fighters, the [[Frostfire]]s are armed with 2 small torpedoes, 6 small phaser spinals, 2 light gatling cannons and lasers. It also has a nearly identical interior to the [[Hasatan]] battleship, with the only difference being ice and snow building up in the corners.\

==Description ==\
The Crescendo is a mid-sized [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] that is based off the [[Hellkeeper]], but is significantly smaller and has nerfed stats than the ship it is derived from. \
==Appearance==\
The Crescendo has crescent like shapes around its ship, related to its name and has a pink-purple color palette unlike the ship it is based from.\
\
The '''Interior''' is a grey box with a purple light. It has a wall of text simillar to the [[Halkaryak]]. There is a simple black seat found in the middle. \
==Advantages==\
*Great [[Turrets|Turret]] and [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] firepower.\
*Has an insane overall speed for it's size, being at 100.\
* Good shield health (9500)\
*High damage to shields, better than the [[Sagittarius]].\
*Fast turret cooldown. \
\
*It has an explosion radius of 1000 ''(10k Studs)'', rivaling that of [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] nukes and can '''severely damage even [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]'''.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Will be mass-targeted because of it being an expensive trophy ship in the [[:Category:Halloween 2021|Halloween 2021 event]].\
*Hard to land spinals on small / medium-sized ships.\
*Unbalanced health (5555 hull).\
*Big blind spot below the ship, but the turn speed can account for it.\
*Extremely big hitbox for it's class, bigger than some super-capitals.\
\
* It's extremely powerful nuke will be a threat to your own fleet/team when your ship is destroyed.\
== Strategy==\
*Do not bring this at wars unless you are confident that you won't die.\
*Do not go alone with this ship inside of a war.\
*If almost hulled, quickly warp back to your base.\
*Can pair up with a hull breaker to form an unstoppable duo.\
*To land targets with your spinals, make sure to aim more up than usual before shooting.\
*Mainly use this ship to take down enemies' shields due it's anti shield firepower.\
*If you think your ship will be destroyed, Warp your ship away as '''far as possible''' from your own fleet or starbase as the nuke has a whopping radius of 12,500 studs, and if possible, you can warp to the enemy's fleet or starbase to bring the nuke there instead.\
==Version History ==\
*Added in version .74b3 during the second part of the [[Halloween Event 2021]].\
*Received +2 Huge Cannons and changed spinal placement in version .74b17.\
*Model archived by ap_ek in an unknown version.\
*Redboxed and refunded, along with many other [[Halloween Event 2021]] ships due it's model being archived in version .75a10.\
== Trivia ==\
*It is ship reward you get by completing the \"Hollow Vessel\" quest in the [[Halloween Event 2021|2021 Halloween Event]].\
*Crescendo's nuke is the largest out of all [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] class ships.\
*First person to lose this ship was silenthunter77777 to a Pirate [[Dissonance]]\
*This ship's event id is 666\

==Description==\
The '''Xenon '''is a siege cruiser with good acceleration, and excels at causing high damage from afar.\
==Interior==\
The interior contains one small room with a computer with a small online conversation on it, with a photo of Wiscyy's user profile next to it.\
==Advantages==\
*Very high health for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].\
*Good Acceleration and Turn Speed.\
*Small size making it harder to hit with larger [[Turrets]].\
*Very high range for a ship of its class, being able to outrange a level 1 [[Starbase]] and many other ships.\
*Insane long-range kinetic turret armament for a Cruiser allows the Xenon to be very effective at hull-breaking without needing spinal aim(4 Light Railguns and 4 Medium Siege Railguns), making this ship viable for beginners.\
*Has a balanced health pool.\
==Disadvantages==\
*It can't defend against other small ships very well.\
*It has no platform to get in the ship, meaning that you can fall out of the world when getting in or out.\
\
*Railguns have low accuracy against moving targets.\
*Incredibly expensive for a non-[[:Category:Limited|Limited]]/[[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] Cruiser.\
==Strategy==\
*Siege low level or short-range bases from a distance with your Medium Siege Railguns.\
*When in combat with small ships try to stay as close to the enemy as possible so your Turrets have an easier shot.\
*When sieging a base of level 2 or higher let your Medium Turrets do the work while you fly around the base to avoid being hit yourself. If any [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] comes to defend, destroy them with your remaining [[Turrets|Small Turrets]].\
*The small size and long range of this ship make it dangerous, especially in fleets: it can avoid base fire and dive in to attack ships trying to despawn.\
==Version History==\
*Max [[Shields|Shield]] increased from 750 to 1000, added one [[Turrets|Medium Railgun]].\
*Received a remodel in version??\
*Replaced 1 Medium Railgun with 1 Point Defense Laser in version[???]\
*Turret loadout changed from 3 Medium Railguns and 2 Light Gatling Cannons to 4 Medium Siege Railguns and 4 Light Railguns(the first ship to be equipped with them), Shield health increased from 1000 to 1200, and top speed increased from 120 to 150 in version .75a5.\
==Trivia==\
*The ship used to be asymmetrical, with only one Flak Cannon on one side.\
*This ship's Medium Railgun was temporarily replaced with a Dual Medium Cannon, but the Medium Railgun was restored on a later date.\
*This ship can outrange the majority of ships, including some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\

== Description==\
The '''Retro Prototype X-1''' is a \"test dreadnought\" based on the [[Prototype X-2]], part of the Retro Ship Event 2023 (LINK) where you could buy it from the Kneall HarbourMaster in a teleporter on [[Aqueous II]] (see picture below).\
==Appearance==\
[[File:Retro Prototype X-2 Location.jpg|thumb|The location for the Retro Prototype X-2 quest teleporter, which is on Aqueous II.]]\
[[File:Retro Prototype X-2 Quest Alien.jpg|thumb|The room for the quest \"Prototype X-2 Quest\", which upon giving 2 million quests to the KNEALL HarbourMaster, you will receive the Retro Prototype X-2]]\
The '''Retro Prototype X-2''' docks with its front facing the starbase. Interior wise, there is a large walkway leading to a seat and a screen, which says nothing. \
==Advantages==\
*High turret count with an armament well-equipped for [[Sieging|Sieges]].\
*Powerful [[Spinals]].\
*Health is well-balanced and has a very high overall total for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], at 33,000 total HP; making it the quite tanky.\
* Spinals have 0 second interval, meaning they are fired all at once.\
*Large cargo hold will allow you to loot valuable items fairly well from NPC ship wrecks.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Rather slow with low maneuverability.\
*Extremely valuable target for superior ships such as super capitals, or groups of pirates; thanks to the outrageously expensive cost of 2 million credits as well as being a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ship.\
*Large blind-spots below, behind, and to the side of the ship.\
*'''''<u>Massive</u>''''' size makes this ship a very easy target to hit for even the most inaccurate turrets or pilots with poor spinal aiming capabilities; not to mention [[Spinal Weaponry|Torpedoes]].\
==Strategy==\
*This is a decent ship for diving battleships and other dreadnoughts when they flee to their base, tank with your health.\
*Do not try to move out of the way of [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Torpedoes]] with regular ship movement alone, as the ship is too large and too sluggish to dodge them. Instead, warp out of the way of any Huge or Large Torpedoes that you see coming towards you.\
*This ship is heavily targeted due to its expense and limited status. As mentioned in the ship's description, use with extreme caution.\
==Version History==\
*added in version .76c13\
==Trivia==\
*One of the most expensive Dreadnoughts released to date at an outstanding cost of 2 million credits\
*It's turrets have sounds from Star Wars\
*This ship is the original model of the Prototype X-2.\

==Description==\
The '''Executioner''' is a [[Ships|Carrier]] that houses two [[Hunter]]s, which are powerful Battlecruiser-like fighters. Unlike most carriers, the '''Executioner '''does not rely fully on its fighters for damage output, as it is equipped with powerful [[Spinals|Spinal]] and [[Turrets|Turret]] weaponry, as well as having a good healthpool to tank damage.\
==Appearance==\
The interior of the '''Executioner''' is a room with 3 teleporters: one to get in or out and 2 for the fighters. The pilot seat is in the middle, & 3 screens line the walls. \
==Advantages==\
*High overall damage output; its average DPS is comparable to that of many [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
\
*Relatively cheap to fully outfit with AI Fighters, as it only has 2 fighters.\
*Great speed and mobility for its class; its maneuverability rivals that of the [[Leviathan]]'s.\
*Its [[Hunter]]s are very strong; they can be compared to [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] firepower-wise and have the 2nd highest health in their class, right behind the [[Elanis]].\
* The fighters can still be used even when recalled, due to them being directly attached to the ship's structure.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Lacks significant long range weaponry. \
\
*Requires good Spinal aiming skills in order to use this ship to its full potential.\
* Because of their positioning, the fighters are also directly exposed to enemy fire and can be easily destroyed when unreleased.\
*Pretty expensive compared to other options.\
==Strategy==\
*Warp to a base, release [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] and warp out. For max damage, let the hunters tank first and deal damage with your turrets.\
*Use the [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] as a distraction for the [[Starbase]] [[Turrets]] or even enemy [[Ships]] as they might overreact seeing your Battlecruiser-sized [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Release [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]], both fighters get used, recall them, they can still attack even if recalled.\
==Version History==\
* Health increased from 6250/5250 to 8000/6000 in version .68d.\
==Trivia == \
*The [[Vansnova]] remodel was based on '''Executioner's''' fighter design.\
*One of the only carriers to have Battlecruisers as [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Spectating Ship''' has 1750 total health and 95% damage resistance (the latter of which is a standard for all Admin ships). It is presumably used to spectate battles.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior is nothing more than a small box containing the pilot's seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Very small.\
* Jet black body makes it extremely hard to see in the void of space.\
* Very fast.\
* Extremely hard to kill due to the fast speed and resistance.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Only admins can use this.\
*Slow for an admin ship (although this is caused by the maximum top speed being 380).\
* No Cargo Hold, which is obvious because it is used for spectating.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use the ship's dark, small body and incredible health/maneuverability to watch huge battles in near complete safety.\
== Version History ==\
* Buffed in .65b—Hull increased from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000, Shield increased from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000, Top Speed increased from 1,000 to 2,500\
* Received a remodel in version .67c.\
* Nerfed in version .69b5, the Hull was decreased from 10,000,000 to 1000 and the Shield was decreased from 10,000,000 to 750, the Top Speed was increased from 2,500 to 10,000, the acceleration was increased from 45 to 60, the turn speed was reduced from 0.9 to 0.8, it gained 2 [[Spinals|Large Phasers]] and received another remodel (which is based on the [[Vampire X-R4]]).\
* Nerfed in the same version that gave it a remodel, losing 2 [[Spinals|Large Phasers]], likely due to being the only admin ship that isn't removed to attack in this case.\
*As of version .69b9, all admin ships including this ship were prevented to be spawned by non-admins if they obtained it due to a glitch.\
*Top Speed '''<u>massively nerfed</u>''' from 10,000 to the maximum top speed (currently 380) in an unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* It is used to spectate special events or for fun.\
* It is the fastest ship in the game by far.\
* Accidentally put on the build menu on October 26, 2020, this marks the first time an admin ship is put into the build menu (albeit the ores required is the highest), this bug caused this ship to be buildable as a free ship in [[Galaxy Arcade]], this has since been patched, and almost every single spectating ships built (all of them are in Galaxy Arcade) were removed by EvilPleeber119.\
* wayken70, a non-admin that obtained it in Galaxy Arcade due to the patched glitch is the first person in history to lose a '''Spectating Ship''', dying to a [[Orca]] nuke. This is not the only spectating ship loss, although it is the first.\
* The '''Spectating Ship''' health nerf is by far the biggest nerf in Galaxy's history, losing 9,999,250 shield health and 9,999,000 hull health.\
*Many people consider to sell/remove their '''Spectating Ships''' to avoid getting busted by other people.\
*Currently has the lowest health out of all admin ships.\
*The current model is similar to the [https://www.halopedia.org/FSS-1000_Sabre FSS-1000 Sabre] from Halo.[[File:SpectatingShipInBuildMenu(RegularGalaxy).png|thumb|The most recent glitch in galaxy, featuring spectating ship in the build menu.|270x270px]]\
*It has 1 cargo hold, making it one of the lowest if not the lowest cargo hold in the game on a ship.\

==Description==\
The '''Retro Advanced Miner''' is a limited version of the Advanced Miner that uses the first model of the [[Advanced Miner]].\
==Interior==\
The interior of the ship is a large room which leads to a ladder. This ladder will lead you to the pilot seat, in a small cabin. The cabin's walls are slightly misaligned.\
==Advantages==\
* Mines Quickly with its 4 [[Turrets|Retro Mining lasers]].\
\
* 5500 Ore hold can earn around 8k Credits each dump.\
* At 30% [[Loyalty]] you can dump for 15k Credits.\
==Disadvantages==\
* It's low health make it easy for [[Pirating|pirates]] to kill if wandering outside of base range.\
* Part of a previous event and once it is lost its gone for good!\
* Requires a pointed-down/pointed-up angle to successfully have all mining turrets active.\
==Strategy==\
* Use it in servers where there are no wars and in private servers, as it is a limited event ship.\
* Due to its small minimap icon, when mining at war (which is highly not suggested), you can hide your miner from the minimap by moving close to docked Capital Ships at the [[Starbase]].\
* Your fast mining speed will do quick ore clean up in a private server where there is a ton of ores.\
* When mining if an alien targets you quickly warp away, aliens can kill you before you fill up your ore hold.\
* If a [[Punisher]] warps to your [[Starbase]], '''DO NOT DOCK.''' Your low health will let it kill you before you even despawn, instead warp 18k away from the [[Starbase]].\
==Version History==\
* Added in version .66b, along with the retro ships of the retro ships limited event.\
* Received a buff in version .66b, when the Retro ship event ended.\
* Nerfed in version .66b—Ore Hold reduced from 6250 to 5500, [[Turrets|Retro Mining Lasers]] nerfed.\
* [[Turrets|Retro Mining Laser]] ore yield increased in version .68d.\
*Ore Hold reduced from 5500 to 5000 in version .70a.\
*Hull decreased by 100 HP (1,600 to 1,500) in version .75a10.\
==Trivia==\
* Many people Regretted losing this ship/not buying/selling this ship because of its major buff after the event.\
\
* The second limited remodel of the [[Advanced Miner]].\
* It's the only miner to use the Old Mining Laser Sounds.\
* Many players were disappointed with this ship a bit of time after the buff of the ship, as the '''Retro Advanced Miner '''received a big nerf. __NOTOC__\
* The miner was originally 80,000 credits or so, soon after being buffed to 300,000 credits, meaning players could profit off of selling this.\
*After RC's Turret standardization to stop overpowered ships in the game, this ship is now basically an [[Advanced Miner]] but with 5000 ore hold.\

==Trivia==\
*Previously, the Ascension Crystal was used in a quest given by the [[Monogram]] in [[Aqueous II]]'s asteroid belt. The Data Archive was used in a quest found on [[Myriad III]]'s moon. They were also used to make special ships called \"Artifact Ships,\" now known as \"[[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]]\" After an exploit for creating these ships came out, they were subsequently disabled and eventually re-added, but this time without the cost of '''Artifacts'''. Instead, their prices rose dramatically. However, recently, they were readded to the Mega Base's Terminal D's sales floor on a 3 ships per rotation basis.

== Description ==\
The '''Coal Wasp''' is a Limited Event ship, a reskin of the [[Wasp]].\
\
The exterior is black and the boosters in the back are white. It is equipped with one [[Turrets|Coal Mining Laser]], just like a normal Wasp. It also has a unique part texture in honor of the \"Coal\" theme.\
\
You could only get this ship by asking a [[Galaxy Staff|Galaxy Admin]] on Christmas during the [[Christmas Event 2017|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Christmas Event 2017</span>]].\
== Appearance ==\
Like the Wasp, the '''Coal Wasp''' has little interior.\
== Advantages  ==\
* Extremely high Top Speed, currently one the fastest non-admin ships in the game, maxing out at 380, tied with the [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] [[Yname (ship)|yname]]. (this is also the maximum top speed in the game).\
* Hard to hit.\
==Disadvantages== \
*2nd lowest health of any ship ever in Galaxy, with 30 total health, only behind [[Kodiak A]] with 2 total health; one hit <u>'''FROM ALMOST ANYTHING'''</u> and it's over.\
*Could only be obtained once via Admins.\
*Players wanting a prize kill will consider this a priority target, as it is now unobtainable and under 100 or so still exist.\
*Dies instantly to a small amount of [[Aliens]], which usually target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
*The Turn Speed is low compared to its Top Speed, making the handling of the '''Coal Wasp''' somewhat awkward.\
*Virtually useless; it's nothing more than a nice trophy ship.\
==Strategy==\
* Treat this ship like a trophy. NEVER use it or sell it, unless you have a [[Galaxy VIP Servers|VIP Server]] and want to show it off.\
* Ask someone if they wanted coal for Christmas. They'll love this piece of coal.\
==Version History==\
*Added in Update .60a.\
*Received a buff in Update .60d that boosted Top Speed from 175 to 500.\
* Warp Drive added in version .61h1?\
*Top Speed nerfed from 500 to the maximum top speed in an unknown version (500 > 400 > 380)\
*Put on the \"Limited Editions (Permit)\" build menu on version .73a3, now also requiring a Class E Permit.\
*Shields/Hull increased from 5/5 to 15/15, ore hold increased from 5 to 1000, small mining laser replaced with coal mining laser in version .73b3.\
==Trivia==\
*Galaxy Admins would give players this along with the [[Festive Wasp|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Festive Wasp</span>]] on Christmas Day during the [[Christmas Event 2017|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Christmas Event 2017</span>]].\
*This ship is considered a meme because of its insane Top Speed (of 380), and extremely low total health (30).\
*One of the few limited event ships available for only one day including the [[Festive Wasp|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Festive Wasp</span>]], [[2018 Ship]] (surprise Raffle ship on Discord), and the [[United States of Razor]].\
*[[Turrets|Gatling Turrets]] are the only [[Turrets]] in the game that won't one-shot this ship.\
*Was one of the only ships without a [[Warp Drive]] for the longest time after its release, although it eventually obtained one alongside every other miner-class ship in version .61h1?\

==Description==\
The '''Permafrost''' is a winter-themed [[Christmas Event 2019]] added in the 1st Phase of the [[Christmas Event 2019]] for Galaxy. \
\
This ship excels at providing firepower support in fleets and diving ships with its insanely high firepower. It is able to effectively evade fire and dish out extreme damage with it's speed and agility in many situations.\
==Appearance==\
[[File:Permafrost_firing.png|thumb|left|Permafrost's spinal pattern]]\
\
The Permafrost is a rather, large destroyer that has a unique shape, resembling other previous [[:Category:Limited| event ships]] like the [[Grim]]. The cockpit is a small cabin located inside a ring of arms and many turrets orbiting around it. The ship's detailing also has icy spikes around it and there are snow/ice particles seemingly flowing to the cabin.\
\
\
The interior is a small cockpit with a detailed, icy chair, and 2 control panels displaying the text: <span style=\"color:#45caf7\">\"'''Making a List...'''\"</span> and <span style=\"color:#45caf7\">\"'''Checking it twice...'''\"</span>.\
\
\
\
\
==Advantages==\
*Is effective against both shields and hull.\
*Good health for a destroyer.\
*The highest damage output of its class, higher than some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*Rapid-fire and accurate turrets makes it effective against both Small and Capital ships.\
*100% [[Strategies#Drifting|Drift Percentage]] makes it good at evading shots and consistently pointed to your target.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Rather large size makes it easier to hit with spinals.\
*Requires good [[Spinals|Spinal]] aim to be effective in PvP.\
*Extremely expensive for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]], requiring a Class D [[Permits|Permit]]\
*Will be targeted due to being a [[:Category:Limited|Limited Ship.]]\
==Strategy==\
*Use your speed and 100% drift to your advantage to dodge as much incoming fire as possible.\
*Use the high firepower on this ship to Dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.\
*This ship is good for Pirating bigger [[Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]].\
*Beware of any explosions from ships you destroy; Your low health will lead to a quick destruction if you don’t pay attention.\
*Always try to hit your spinals, they account for a large portion of your DPS.\
*Avoid going too close to a Capital Ship, as you will have a hard time hitting your Spinals and their Turrets will shred you.\
*Be wary when attacking ships larger than Dreadnoughts as their powerful weaponry could easily tear you apart.\
*Know when to retreat, this ship is very costly for its class and isn’t worth losing.\
==Version History==\
*Permafrost health increased to 1000/1000, spinals upclassed to Small, turret damage and range adjusted, speed increased in version .72f\
==Trivia==\
* You used to need to kill [[Aliens]] during the Christmas Event to get the [[Snowflake]]s ''(10)'' required to build this ship\

"Permits","== Description ==\
'''Permits''' are special [[Materials]] used in the creation of [[ships]] on the [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] Build Menu. They are typically available exclusively at the [[Mega Base]], and are quite expensive compared to other purchasable components.\
\
The current price of Build permits can be checked from the Mega Base, or if not possible, in the [https://discord.com/invite/robloxgalaxy Galaxy Discord], type the command <code>/permits</code> in the bot channel to show current permit prices.\
==Pricing==\
Prices of build permits can vary directly with the demand, often inflating or deflating overtime and <u>'''there is no price ceiling'''</u> meaning the price of all permits have no limit in how expensive they can be. ''(An example of is the Class B permit which was in the 3-5 million range, until the [[Lucifer]] was made Class B, ballooning the demand for the permit, and therefore ballooning the price to 8 million plus, until it was reverted back to Class A, making Class B's price fall.)''\
\
All Permits, over time will have their prices fall and could theoretically reach 0 if given enough time. Buying any type of Permit will raise that permit's price after it goes out of stock due to demand.\
\
'''The more a type of permit is available in [[Mega Base]], the higher rate that its price will fall.'''\
\
== Permits ==\
'''''This section only shows the current lowest and highest price the permits have as of the past 3 Months.'''''\
\
Currently, there are six types of '''permits''': \
\
{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\
|+Permits\
!Permit\
!Price Range\
!Example Ships and Classes\
|-\
|'''SC Build Permit'''\
|3.8-6 Million\

|-\
|'''Class A Permit'''\
|15-25 Million\
|[[Freedom Galaxy]], [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]], [[Lucifer]], [[Retro Prototype X-1|RX-1]].\
|-\
|'''Class B Permit'''\
|3.5-5 Million\

|-\
|'''Class E Permit'''\
|200k-500k\
|Limited [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]], [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyers]], and [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]].\
|-\
|}\
==Advantages==\
* Many ships requiring permits are far more powerful than normal ships, and if you are patient, investing in them may be worth your time.\
*Many Limited ships that used to be unobtainable are now obtainable via the Limited Build Menu.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Extremely expensive. Prices vary by '''permit''' class, but all are insanely expensive compared to the ships they let you build.\
*Buying limited ships via permits is often considered not worth it, because they are usually targeted and permits are incredibly expensive, along with the fact that many limited ships aren't that much more effective overall compared to regular ones. This means simply using normal ships repeatedly can be a better option.\
*Contrary to the meaning of their names, '''permits''' are consumed upon building a single ship, rather than generally permitting you to build ships of their respective class. People who buy them may not know this and will often be disappointed after finding out and buying a limited ship.\
*Only obtainable through purchasing with [[credits]], not dropped by any [[:Category:NPC|NPC]] ships or rewarded by [[:Category:Quest|quests]]\
*Some classes of permits may be out of stock for long periods of time.\
*Prices for permits often balloon due to demand, so obtaining certain permits can be difficult to acquire for long periods of time.\
==Trivia==\
*Before the Alphabetical Permits were introduced, there was a permit known as the \"''Event Build Permit''\". It functions as part of the build cost for all past event ships, even [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]]. Such permit could only be acquired via refunds or trade-ins.\

The '''''Kapisi''''' was an exclusive [[:Category:Limited|'''Carrier''']] for those who contributed to or purchased from the Galaxy Store during the [[Halloween Event 2018]].\
== Description ==\
The '''Kapisi''' is a mid-sized [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]], and a reskin of the [[Sakala]]. It has a large bridge section and two fighter bays connected by transparent pathways. Each bay feeds into a central launching area that leads to the outside of the ship. The [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] contains 12 [[Bonehawk]] [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
== Appearance ==\
Like it's original counterpart, the [[Sakala]], he interior of the '''Kapisi''' consists of a teleporter that leads straight to the ships bridge (Which is inside the hanger of the ship). If you choose not to walk onto the teleporter, you would find yourself walking down a long pathway where you can see the [[Bonehawk]]s. The left side of the carrier is exactly the same as the right site, excluding the ramp to exit or enter the ship. Inside each hanger (which consist of 2 [[Bonehawk]] Fighters), there is an array of seats so that people planning to pilot the [[Bonehawk]]s may have a spot to sit while the carrier warps.\
== Advantages ==\
* No blind spots.\
* Quite fast and maneuverable for its size and class.\
* Very powerful [[Turrets]] that do balanced damage.\
* Many powerful [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* Large cargo hold.\
* High health compared to most build menu carriers.\
*Fighters' DPS totals to a ridiculous 1644, the most fighter DPS of '''any''' carrier in the game.\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Significant target for [[Pirates]].\
* Lacks [[Turrets|Small Turrets]].\
* Bad [[Turrets|Turret]] placement.\
* Extremely rare, alongside the [[Blizzard]] and the [[Sakala]].\
*Limited event ship, putting a giant target on it.\
*Costs a TON to equip all it's fighters with AI pilots costing 3000 robux without VIP, only being beaten by the Nimitz.\
== Strategy ==\
* Be sure to have teammates to make use of the [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* When in doubt, don't use it. It is an extremely prized target for [[Pirates]] and bounty hunters.\
* Stay at the back of the fleet and take down any large ships that come near you.\
* While the '''Kapisi''' has a combined health of 18,000 it wouldn't be recommended to tank anything due to the amount of players that would target a hulled, limited [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
== Version History ==\
* Made unobtainable after the [[Halloween Event 2018|Halloween 2018 Event]] ended.\
* Health increased from 7000/7000 to 9000/9000 in version .68d.\
*Remodeled in version .75a5.\
== Trivia ==\
[[File:Bonehawk.png|thumb|220x220px|Bonehawk Fighter]]\
* Much of the roof in the back of this ship has no collision, allowing you to jump in and out of the ship through the ceiling.\
* Benboto was the first player to lose a '''Kapisi''' (lost it within the first two minutes of him spawning it for the first time). \
* The '''''Kapisi''''' is a reference to the command carrier Kapisi from Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak. \

==Description==\
The '''Industrial Miner''' has the sixth-quickest mining speed out of all standard [[Mining]] ships in the game due to its two [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]]. The ship has low health, only being able to withstand a few hits from [[Turrets|Medium]] and [[Turrets|Heavy weapons]] before being destroyed. Physically, the ship has four main thrusters behind the bridge, four large containers for [[Ores]], and a tapered front end resembling an old model of the [[Advanced Miner]]. It takes a minimum of 150 seconds to fill up its hold.\
==Appearance==\
The '''Industrial Miner's''' interior consists only of a short, yellow and gray hallway separated from the pilot's seat by a team-colored \"door.\" The pilot's seat is about as tall as the player, black and gray in color, and faces an empty, gray room.\
==Advantages==\
*Sixth fastest mining speed in the game.\
*Sixth largest [[Ores]] hold in the game.\
*The two [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] have a range of 5500 studs, the same as the [[Rorqual]].\
*Affordable.\
==Disadvantages ==\
*Low [[Shields]] and [[Hull]] for its size.\
*Same mining speed as the [[Advanced Miner]] which costs around 2k [[Credits]] less.\
*Can be easily destroyed if too far from a [[Starbase]]/ the [[Mega Base|Megabase]].\
*[[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
==Strategy==\
*Check if any enemies are coming every 30 seconds, either by looking around or on the [[Minimap]].\
*Always mine in a peaceful faction to ensure safe [[Mining]].\
*If in a [[War]], check enemy locations every 30 seconds to avoid destruction of your [[Ships|Ship]].\
*If an [[Aliens|Alien]] ship or an enemy ship is approaching you, head back to base.\
*If an [[Aliens|Alien]] ship is targeting your [[Starbase]] while you are mining, stay where you are.\
*If possible, mine in a [[Galaxy VIP Servers|VIP Server]] to ensure safety from pirates. \
\
*Don't mine at the [[Mega Base]] during [[War]], especially without protection.\
==Version History==\
*Received a remodel in version .56b.\
*Received a buff that increased its mining range by 50%.\
*Received a buff in .61e4 that doubled the ship's health and added ''some'' damage resistance.\
*.61h1? - [[Warp Drive]] added.\
*Received another remodel in version .65a.\
==Trivia==\
*It takes the '''Industrial Miner''' about 2.5 minutes to get a full Ore Hold of [[Ores|Silicate]].\
*Brings in about 1875 [[Credits]] without any [[Loyalty]] per run, but can earn up to 3375.\
*Used to be the biggest [[:Category:Miner|Miner]], before the [[Rorqual]], [[Mammoth]], [[M Class]], and [[Orca]] came.\
*A top pick for new players because of its low cost and high credit output as it will out pay its cost in 3 runs at 1% [[Loyalty]].\
*Gives players who kill it 1,327 [[Bounty]] (outdated).\

== Description==\
The '''Rhino''' is the fourth largest [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] in the game and has the second most [[:Category:fighters|Fighters]] excluding limited carriers. The Turret placement allows for decent defense from any side of the ship except underneath.\
==Appearance==\
The rhino is remodeled, all descriptions and images are currently inaccurate. \
==Advantages==\
* Large amount of [[Frenzy|Frenzies]] and [[Striker]]s combined.\
*High health.\
*The fighters possess incredible combined firepower if used in a swarm.\
*Variety of accurate [[Turrets]].\
*Fairly low [[Warehouse]] requirement.\
*The carrier itself can provide decent pest control support.\
*One of the best [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] for fighter support.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Vulnerable underside and rear.\
*The carrier itself is weak against ships of its size.\
*Poor maneuverability.\
*Large profile makes it a big target.\
*Has a low [[Spinals|Spinal]] count.\
*You'll need an entire team that is willing to fly the fighters.\
*Equipping all fighters with AI pilots is relatively costly, costing 2500 robux without VIP.\
==Strategy==\
*Use the high Fighter count to swarm bases and opposing Ships.\
*The Rhino itself can provide good support against small, fast ships due to all turrets being flaks and PDLs.\
*The '''Rhino's''' exposed underside, slow speed, sub-optimal Turret types, and awkward handling means it will need support from a fleet, or a [[Starbase]] to survive any dedicated assault.\
*When [[Sieging]], stay out of range of the base but turn sideways towards it to allow faster Fighter release. Also, bring some [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]] and [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyers]] as escorts to defend against the [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] that may counterattack.\
==Version History==\
*After being added, the '''Rhino''' received a remodel in an unknown version.\
*Health buff in .65b\
*Health increased from 8000/7250 to 11000/8000 and loadout changed to 4 Light Flak Cannons, 1 Light Laser, 2 Heavy Flak Cannons, and 2 Heavy Point Defense Lasers in version .68d.\
*Replaced 4 Frenzies with 4 Strikers in version .73a3.\
*Health decreased to 10000/7000 in version 75a5.\

* Used to be one of the only Carriers with non-solid Fighter bay doors. Because of this, players could walk through the doors and even pilot small ships into the '''Rhino'''. This has since been removed with the new interior remodel, although players can still pilot small ships into the '''Rhino''' with proper timing.\
*Named after the species Rhinoceros.\

== Description ==\
The '''Sixfold'''<nowiki/>'s signature appearance and the name come from the six wings attached to its main body that hold turrets and thrusters for the ship. It has two prominent rotary cannons attached to the sides of the bridge.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Sixfold''' has more interior with its remodeling. The '''Sixfold''' has 2 floors, with a ramp leading up to the second floor. The first floor has 2 ore makers for decoration, which you can walk through, but with partial difficulty.\
[[File:RobloxScreenShot20190217 152629119.png|thumb|220x220px|Second Floor Interior]]\
[[File:RobloxScreenShot20190217 152648236.png|thumb|220x220px|BedRoom]]\
As you walk up the ramp to the second floor, you will notice the cockpit in front of you, and a bedroom some distance behind the cockpit. The cockpit has been more refurbished with the remodeling. The bedroom has a bed, a desk, an office chair, and a photo of the ship modeler. The bed and the desk are similar to the [[Osprey]]'s bed and desk.\
== Advantages ==\
* Great mobility.\
* Extremely high firepower for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]], with 6 [[turrets|Light Turrets]] and 12 [[Spinals|Tiny Cannons]]; it is the cruiser with the highest damage output so far.\
* Able to do a great amount of burst damage.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Very little health.\
* Very large, allowing it to be easily hit and torn apart by weapons from larger ships, such as [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
* Expensive.\
* Odd turret placement making it difficult to utilize all turrets at once, especially while moving.\
== Strategy ==\
* Even though it is large, it can dodge enemy [[Turrets]] easily at a distance because of its mobility.\
* It excels against small ships with its small [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower. You can even hit with the [[Spinals|Spinal]] cannons if you are traveling in the same direction and aim carefully.\
* A good choice for [[Pirating|Pirates]] as it offers all-around turret firepower and powerful [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower.\
* It can be used effectively during a siege as a support and distraction craft.\
* Use its [[Spinals]] against bigger or slower ships to deal with massive hull damage.\
* If you can form a pack of these, it is possible to take down a [[Starbase]].\
== Version History ==\
* In update .62a? the ship got a remodel which added more decor, a second floor, and a bedroom.\
* Hull increased from 500 to 700 in version .68e.\
== Trivia ==\
* The old model was remade once before being added to the game.\
* The health and spinals used to be the opposite of the [[Lusso]]'s.\
* It is possible to destroy an [[Punisher|Alien Punisher]] using this ship, as long as it is not targeted/locked on by the alien. Take caution, however, as the resulting explosion can easily wipe out one of these, even with full health.\

== Description ==\
The '''Witch''' is a very fast [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] and it is built from the same basic model as the [[Warlock]]. It has [[Turrets|6 Medium Turrets]]. The '''Witch's '''main visual difference from the Warlock is its lack of the engine ring near the back of the ship. This matches the \"stripped down\" description of the ship.\
\
It's a very fast ship with a Top Speed of 110. It has (F) and (G) [[Spinals]] which are 4 [[Spinals|Medium Cannons]] and 4 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]].\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Witch''' is the exact same as the interior of the [[Warlock]]. There is a small teleporter pad that leads to a hallway stretching nearly the entire length of the ship. The hallway has three wider openings with a set of three windows on each side of the openings. The middle opening contains one large pilot's seat and a faction-colored neon screen.\
== Advantages ==\
* Extreme mobility, slightly faster than the [[Ampharos]].\
* High firepower from both [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]].\
* Lots of forward/backward turret range and lines of sight, backside is a very small blind spot.\
* Flexible [[Turrets]], still capable of hitting smaller ships while dealing reasonable damage to Capital Ships.\
* Excellent PVP skills.\
* This ship is a great [[Pirating]] ship as it can tank low-level [[Starbase]]s and kill miners even when they are close to their [[Starbase]], while still being able to warp away.\
*Due to its high Speed and relatively high general durability, diving is a relatively easy task, however it's not completely immune to damage.\
* Good shield DPS of 160 and good hull DPS of 150\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Vulnerable bottom against shield tanks.\
*Easy to swarm with small ships, or out-gun with heavily armed ships.\
*Weak to ships of its class.\
*Mostly laser turrets so hull can not be efficiently taken care of when only using turrets.\
==Strategies==\
* Use in pairs to maximize [[Spinals|Spinal]] damage.\
* It can be used to protect larger ships from fighters, using it's turrets, or from larger ships, using it's spinals.\
* Use this for [[Pirating]] as it has very good [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] speed and firepower, and is able to tank [[Starbase]]s shortly to finish ships off.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a test remodel in .62a1 (there was also a bug that removed its [[Spinals]]).\
* Buffed in .66b, increasing its shield from 2250 to 3250, its hull from 2000 to 2500, as well as receiving a Triple Heavy Laser.\
* Received a remodel in version .66k?\
* Nerfed health in .67b reducing 2500 shield to 2250 shield 2500 Hull to 2000 Hull.\
* [[Shields|Shield]] reduced to 2600, 3 [[Spinals|Large Cannons]] and 2 [[Spinals|Large Phasers]] changed to 4 [[Spinals|Medium Cannons]] and 4 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] in version .69a1.\
* 4 Medium Lasers replaced with 4 Dual Medium Lasers in version .75a5.\
*Explosion Size 40 ----> 265 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
* As of the latest version, the '''Witch''' and [[Warlock]] models are identical aside from the ring at the rear of the [[Warlock]].[[File:Dennis witch.png|thumb|263x263px|Old witch model|none]]\

== Description ==\
The '''Glacier''' is a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ship made for the [[Christmas Event 2017|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Christmas Event 2017</span>]]. It was originally a reskin of the [[Aegis]], with 500 less [[Shields]] and 800 more [[Hull]].\
== Appearance ==\
The old '''Glacier''' had an interior that was exactly identical to the [[Aegis]]. The '''Glacier's''' newest remodel has drastically reduced the amount of interior the ship had originally.\
== Advantages ==\
* High [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
* High [[Shields]].\
* Highest acceleration of any [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* [[Spinals]] deal great damage.\
* Large Cargo Hold for its class.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low hull.\
* Vulnerable top.\
* Very expensive for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* No longer being sold. If you lose this ship, it's gone.\
== Strategy ==\
* While many of the strategies for the [[Aegis]] apply to this ship, its increased health makes it much more effective for tanking [[Hull]]-breakers .\
* Beware of [[Shields|Shield]]-shredders, as your formidable health pool is reduced to nothing in a matter of seconds when up against one of these, such as the [[Zeus]].\
* This is a great chaser, as the 8 [[Spinals|Medium Cannons]] are quite useful in destroying hulled ships.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .60.\
* Received a major buff and slight nerf in .60d that reduced [[Shields|Shield]] by 200 and buffed [[Hull]] by 1200.\
* Remodeled in .61h1?\
* Hull increased from 1500 to 3500, Speed increased from 60 to 100, Medium Railguns replaced with Crystal railguns in version .68e\
*Explosion size 300 ----> 560 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Glacier''' costs exactly double the amount of the [[Aegis]].\
* Highest [[Shields|Shield]] of any [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* For a limited amount of time after the [[Christmas Event 2017|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Christmas Event 2017</span>]], the ship was able to be built for nearly half of its original value (the reason for this is still unknown).\
* Was not able to spawn onto servers after a ''very long'' remodeling process, this issue has since been resolved.\
* Between the '''Glacier''' and its normal buildable counterpart, the [[Aegis]] Battleship, the '''Glacier''' exceeds in health by 2000 (although it has 800 less [[Shields]] and 2800 more [[Hull]]), Top Speed by 20, Acceleration by 5, Turn Speed by 0.05, loses 1 [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]] for 2 [[Turrets|Light Lasers]], loses 2 [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]], loses 2 [[Turrets|Medium Cannons]] (turret) for 2 [[Turrets|Medium Crystal Railguns]], and contains 2 extra [[Spinals|Medium Cannons]] (spinal).\
* The second most expensive battleship in game.\
*The total health of this ship is the same as [[Plagued Warship]] but with the [[Shields]] and [[Hull]] reversed.\
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a D class permit (675k credits) + 5281 Sillicate, 3903 Carbon, 2882 Iridium, 442Adamantite, 751 Palladium, 498 Titanium, 498 Quantium, and 51 Uranium.\

==Description ==\
The '''Elanis '''is a powerful, [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]-like fighter that is spawned on the [[Hevnetier]]. It is a uniquely-designed fighter which integrates into the front of the carrier it spawns on.\
==Appearance==\
The Elanis is a large, flat, triangular fighter with a cyber aesthetic identical to its Carrier, the [[Hevnetier]]. The ship uniquely makes out the front of the Hevnetier.\
\
The interior of the '''Elanis '''is entered through a teleporter at the back, and it is nothing more than a small box with a neon screen containing the pilot's seat.\
==Advantages==\
*Very high health for a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]]-class ship.\
*Fires all spinals at the same time.\
*Has a '''Monstrous [[Galaxy Slang|Shield DPS]]''' of 457, higher than [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] shield breakers like [[Sagittarius]] and [[Zeus]].\
*Flat size might make it a challenge to hit with heavier weapons.\
*Extreme agility and speed for a Battleship-size fighter.\
*Good turret placement.\
*Has 90% [[Strategies#Drifting|Drift]], like all other [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Can provide as much support as most [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
* Insane amount of [[Turrets]] for a fighter, with a whopping 8.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Very low [[Galaxy Slang|Hull DPS]] compared to Shield.\
* Only one spawns on the [[Hevnetier]].\
*Large, and has no damage resistance.\
*No warp drive.\
==Strategy==\
*Get a skilled player inside the Elanis, as AI Fighters shoot spinals inconsistently and turn their backs sometimes, losing half of its firepower.\
*As this is a fighter feel free to do suicide runs.\
*Turn your '''Elanis''' 90 Degrees from its axis then [[Strategies#Drifting|Drift]], but with Z and C, this makes it much more harder for enemies to hit you.\
*Focus on shield tanks like the [[Judgement]] or [[Aegis]] first, as the Elanis focuses on shredding shields.\
*If fighting or providing support against a fleet, avoid Hull tanks like the [[Armageddon]] as the Elanis has extremely low Hull damage compared to Shield Damage.\
*Use your turrets while recalled without the problem of needing to be recalled in order for the Hevnetier to warp.\
*Can be used with the [[Hevnetier]] in conjunction to offset its low hull damage.\
==Version History==\
*Introduced in version .69a2.\
*Buffed in .75a3<sup>(Please list what was changed about the ship)</sup>.\
*Buffed again in .75a10. 115 to 200 Speed, 0.3 to 0.5 Turn speed, 35 to 50 Acceleration. Gains 2 more Small Phasers and 5 Small Cannons replaced with 5 Small Phasers.\
==Trivia==\
* The '''Elanis''' is unique in the sense that it is the only [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] that is part of its respective carrier's main structure. In this instance, the '''Elanis''' makes up the front of the [[Hevnetier]].\
*One of the strongest fighters in the game, tied with the [[A - Bionicle]], which is also a Battleship-like fighter and also one of the only 2 [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]-like fighters in the game.\
*A [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] variant called the [[Mega Elanis]] was released in the April Fools 2022 event. The ship was redboxed due to it being free and incredibly overpowered for it's class.\

==Description==\
The '''Swarmer''' is the [[Aliens|Alien]] equivalent of a [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]]/[[:Category:Fighters|Fighters|Fighter]] and is well known for annoying [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]]. It is mostly black with small neon areas and has a bottom-mounted [[Turrets|Turret]].\
==Behavior==\
'''Swarmers''' will attempt to stay around 3 to 3.5K studs away from whatever they are attacking and may move below [[Ships]] to maintain their turret's line of sight. When attacking a slow or stationary target, they are often seen moving back and forth in mostly straight lines. They have a tendency to go underneath Ships to make it hard for main [[Turrets]] to hit.\
\
'''Swarmers''' will always answer a call from an [[Punisher|Alien Punisher]] when it is attacking any player or Starbase. Hordes of '''Swarmers''' can easily destroy [[Starbase]]s, even if said Starbase is the maximum level. Even if the Punisher or ship they were called to was destroyed, the leftover fleet stays, unless they are called to another Alien ship. Additionally, it appears that spawning Swarmers, along with [[Bruiser]]s and [[Outrider]]s, will still go to a calling Punisher's location for a few minutes even after it is destroyed.\
\
Swarmers are more likely to attack [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]], so stay alert and look at the [[Minimap]] every few minutes when [[Mining]] or [[Trading]]\
==Strategy==\
Due to their small profile and high top speed, '''Swarmers''' are best attacked using ships with high-accuracy [[Turrets]]. Light and Medium-sized [[Turrets]], aside from Railguns, best fit these guidelines.\
==Loot==\
'''Swarmers''' drop 10 Alien Parts.\
== Trivia ==\
* Has a Laughable Explosion value of 8\
* The '''Swarmer''' got a remodel in version .65a6.\
* The '''Swarmer '''has a purple trail.\
* If the player that is attacking them [[Warp Drive|Warps]] away, they will likely not follow and will go away, or if in a fleet, scatter.\
* Swarmers are often seen as nuisances more than threats to many players (although can still be dangerous in fleets or against low-health [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
* Old models can be seen here:\
* Received a Halloween remodel for the 2019 Halloween Event, receiving a brown icon and a recolor to a brown/orange combination, eventually being removed for lag issues.\
* At the same time, the Swarmer Received 25 Uranium as its drop for the [[Halloween Event 2019|2019 Halloween Event]], then being increased to 75 Uranium, becoming very if not ''extremely'' profitable.\
* The Swarmer received an update in .66b in which the Tiny Alien Laser received a reload decrease to 0.2 seconds and 2 damage, meaning large amounts of these ships will cause lag in older/slower devices.\
* Based on its loot, a '''Swarmer''' would take the following materials to build: 140 Silicate, 113 Carbon, 27 Iridium, 27 Adamantine, 13 Palladium, 20 Titanium, 20 Quantium, and 500 Uranium. It would have a build cost of 23,240 Credits, 20,500 of which is the 500 Uranium.\
*Unlike the Bruiser, Outrider and Punisher, there is no limit to how many can be spawned in a server at any time. However, the alien spawn limit of 20 still applies.\
*A video exists with at least 100 Swarmers present on the map, made by Sean Morabito: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItJSuvcZGVs Link]\

\
==Description==\
The '''Apotheosis''' is a Battleship introduced in Part 1 of the [[Halloween Event 2022]]. It is equipped with a multitude of kinetic-oriented unique turret weaponry such as its [[Turrets|Spore Launchers]] and has very good [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] firepower. The ship also features a high and balanced health pool for its class and overall satisfactory maneuverability. These characteristics make it a great PVP ship. It can also contribute in sieges due to the moderately high range its turrets and spinals have.\
\
This Battleship can be obtained by completing quest #20221012, \"[[The plague]]\".\
==Appearance ==\
The Apotheosis's exterior features a very long and slender frame. The ship's dominant color is a deep shade of green, however it also has multiple lime green neons and grey areas. Multiple drill-like cones are also located at the back of the ship. The former traits give this ship a sci-fi look, however the latter adds a hint of biology to the theme of the ship. It is also worth noting that the front of the ship's structure heavily ressembles a blade.\
\
The interior consists of a simple hallway with a glowing green orb at the front containing the pilot seat. Infront of the orb are three turquoise neon panels. The teleporters leading to inside and outside the ship are invisible. The teleporter in the interior is located on the floor, behind the orb. The one on the exterior is situated right behind the very front part of the bow (the spinal firing point).\
==Advantages==\
*Very impressive hull DPS, clocking in at '''397''', putting this ship above many limited [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] in terms of hull damage output.\
*Balanced and decent health pool.\
*Fast turn speed of '''{{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turn_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = '{{PAGENAME}}'}}'''.\
*Overall has very good damage output; its average DPS is on the very high end for a Battleship.\
*The [[Turrets|Bio Light Spore Launchers]] are surprisingly very accurate, providing passable defense against individual subcapital ships.\
*Powerful spinals. Its average spinal DPS nears that of the [[Jackal]]'s.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Slightly problematic turret placement; the ship has to be pointing towards the enemy in order for all the turrets to have a line of sight. However, even then, some turrets might be blocked, mainly the rearmost Spore Launcher.\
*Relies on its spinals for a good portion of its total damage output, especially towards shields.\
*Its large turrets suffer from inaccuracy.\
*Sluggish acceleration.\
==Strategy==\
*Use the long bow of this ship to wedge yourself under your enemies.\
*Beware of swarms of smaller ships, as they can easily spell your demise due to your rather inadequate point defenses.\
*Aim your spinals well; more than half of your total damage output comes from them.\

== Description ==\
The '''Erebus''' is a Dreadnought from the [[Halloween Event 2019]] with high firepower and a resemblance to the [[Grim]].\
\
This ship excels at [[Galaxy Slang|diving]] Ships and being a powerhouse in a fleet due to its firepower.\
== Appearance ==\
The Erebus is a mid-sized Dreadnought with a unique, complex, spiky and symmetrical appearance that stands out from other Dreadnoughts. On its front are 4 Orbital turrets and many spinal barrels sticking out centered around its most defining feature being its almost hollow center full of orbs.\
\
The Erebus has a cylindrical shaped interior with a pilot seat that has a granite texture.\
== Advantages ==\
*High total health of 16,332 for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
*Powerful and [[Galaxy Slang|Balanced]] firepower from its [[Turrets]] and [[Spinal Weaponry]].\
*Fantastic for PvP against other Capital Ships.\
*Extremely fast for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] with its turn-speed and top speed.\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Large [[Galaxy Slang|blindspot]] behind the ship.\
* Inaccurate turrets have difficulty hitting anything smaller than a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
* Spinal firing arcs are spread apart, making it difficult to hit small targets.\
* Will be hunted due to it being expensive and limited.\
== Strategy ==\
*Aim at your target and unleash all spinals to deal massive damage.\
*When fighting other ships, use your high mobility to try and work your way into your enemy's weak points and blindspots.\
*Use this ship's extreme maneuverability to cover for your blindspot and allow you to aim faster targets with your spinals.\
*Don't travel alone on this ship during heavy wars, this ship will get targeted because it is a limited ship and it is really expensive.\
*Use it if you are sure the risks are not too big, a skilled team can destroy these if you are not careful.\
*Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship.\
*Avoid smaller Ships, as your Turrets are not accurate enough to hit them.\
==Version History==\
*Heavily nerfed in version .66b—Spinal barrels reduced from 8/8 to 4/4, Obliterator damage reduced from 140 to 85, Decimator damage increased from 36 to 38, reload increased from 0.2s to 1s, Shield reduced from 8000 to 7000, Hull reduced from 8000 to 6500, Top speed reduced from 125 to 60, Turn-speed reduced from 0.38 to 0.15.\
*Changed from a quest ship to a regular build menu in version ???\
*Uranium cost reduced from 10000 to 5000 in version ???\
*Uranium cost removed in version ???\
*Shields/Hull increased from 7000/6500 to 7666/6666 in version .73a3.\
*Spinal count increased from 4/4 to 6/6 in version .73b3\
*Explosion Size 200 ----> 910 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The first person to lose one was ShadowChaosXD to Lttlethan's [[Lucifer]] explosion.\
* The '''Erebus''' vaguely resembles the Grim, a ship from the [[Halloween Event 2018]].\
*Originally was obtained through a quest which required 1,000,000 credits. \
* Has the second fasted turn-speed out of all Dreadnoughts, only beaten by the [[SR-71]].\

==Description==\
The '''Gryphon''' is a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] with 3 [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannons]]. It is equipped with very high mobility unseen by many other [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]]. This ship has a very futuristic design and well-built engines.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Gryphon''' has a large bay door that opens to the inside of the ship. The main bay contains 12 [[Factions|faction]]-colored passenger chairs that players can sit in. The pilot's seat is rather small and in an elevated area compared to the rest of the seats.\
\
The side ladder leads to the underside, with a small hallway leading to both ends of the ship. Between them, there is the interior, which has a bunk bed and a computer. There is a chair in front of the computer which you can sit in. Various images can be found on the monitor, and lots of notes can be found in or around the garbage bin next to it.\
==Advantages ==\
* [[Spinals]] are strong against smaller or similarly sized [[ships]].  \
* High [[Turrets|Turret]] accuracy and range.  \
* Good health and mobility, a rare combo for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]]. \
* Hard-counters most [[Ships]] ranging from [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]] to [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]]. \
* Great damage output for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].\
* Balanced damaged against both [[Shields]] and [[Hull]].\
==Disadvantages ==\
* Very large for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].   \
* Awkwardly placed [[Spinals]] make it hard to hit smaller [[ships]] up close.   \
* Out-gunned by higher class [[ships]].\
*Relies on spinals for shield damage.   \
==Strategy ==\
* Gather a fleet of '''Gryphons''' and chase down fleeing [[ships]] for easy kills.\
* Don't engage in a head-to-head fight with [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] and up, instead strafe around them or fight in numbers.\
* Use your agility to attack [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]], [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyers]] and other [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]] using your [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannons]] to chip their health.\
==Version History==\
*In version .65a6, its [[Turrets|Dual Gatlings]] were replaced by [[Turrets|Medium Flaks]].\
* Max [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] increased from 700/925 to 1000/1000, [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannon]] count increased from 2 to 3 in version .65b\
*Gained a 3rd Medium Flak Cannon, a Light Flak Cannon and partshifting was fixed in version .72d\
==Trivia ==\
*On the front of the previous model, there are bumps that appear to have been six tiny [[Spinals]].\
*One of the only ships to be reskinned as an Admin ship.\

== Appearance ==\
The interior is simple. Upon entry of the tiny yellow control room, there is a seat and 3 screens that operate the [[Turrets|Mining Lasers]].\
== Advantages ==\
* Fairly affordable.\
* It Is the [[Harvester]]’s equal in mining speed, but is better in other stats.\

* Fairly decent speed for a [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
* Has a large ore hold of 3,500, which is 3,000 larger than Tango's ore hold.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* An easy target for [[Pirating|Pirates]].\
* [[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
* Small range with the Tiny Mining Lasers at 4,000 studs.\
* Has no cargo hold.\
== Strategy ==\
* Should only be used during peaceful times.\

* One of the newer [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] to be added to the game.\
* The '''Hornet''' was proposed a long time ago with one [[Turrets|Medium Mining Laser]] but was finally added in .61g with three [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] instead.\
* The explosion radius has been reduced to 0 multiple times due to a Roblox glitch.\
* Earns enough credits to pay for itself in approximately 1-2 trips.\
* Three times better than the [[Wasp]] in every way except for speed.\
* There was noticeable part overlap in the original model, most notably in the cockpit, creating a \"glitchy\" effect when looked at.\
* There's an image of Hornet from Hollow Knight on one of the screens.\
* When it was first released, the explosion was so powerful that it was able to 1 shot certain battleships.\
* If a new player uses all the [[codes]], they can sell their new ships and purchase the Hornet, drastically and quickly improving their in-game progress.\
* Previously in [[Galaxy Arcade]], it was referred as the obama-sphere as some joke to bait people that it is the best ship in the game.\

The '''Sagittarius''' is entirely focused on dealing extremely heavy shield damage at a distance. This [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] is not commonly seen, but is very, '''very '''useful for crippling [[Starbase]]s or ship [[Shields]]. Extremely useful when paired with ships such as the [[Ridgebreaker]].\
== Appearance ==\
You enter the interior using a teleporter on the back of the ship. When you are inside the interior, you will see a pilot seat in front of you. In front of the seat, you will see three screens, the screen on the left shows the ship's status, the screen in the center just says \"Loading...\" in white text, and the screen on the right has a list of targets.\
== Advantages ==\
* '''''Extremely''''' effective against shields, as the full laser armament practically melts through them.\
* Balanced and high health pool.\
* [[Spinals|Phasers]] deal massive damage.\
* Long ranged [[Turrets]], making it good for breaking Starbase shields during a siege.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Slow for a Dreadnought.\
* No [[Hull]]-focused weaponry.\
* Vulnerable backside.\
* Unable to effectively [[Sieging|Siege]] a Starbase alone.\
* Almost no effective self-defense from smaller [[Ships]].\
* Poor line of sight with the turrets.\
== Strategies ==\
* Should be used to tear down the Shields of [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]]/Starbases.\
* During a siege, use it in conjunction with a [[:Category:Hull breaker|Hull-breaker]] such as the Ridgebreaker.\
* Stay as far away as possible from enemies so you can fire all 9 [[Turrets]] while being able to retreat safely.\
* When in a Siege, open fire until the Shields are down, then leave. Don't risk using this to damage Hull because it isn't going to work.\
* Use your Spinals; more than half of your damage output comes from them.\
* Only use this if your team can support you effectively.\
== Version History ==\
* When it was added into the game the '''Sagittarius''' was nerfed heavily from the original model, being stripped of two Light Flak Cannons, two Light Lasers, -450 Shield, -450 Hull, and 12 speed.\
* Remodeled in an unknown version.\
* Remodeled again in version .65b.\
* Received 4 Long Range Lasers in version .66b, 1 Medium Flak Cannon replaced with 1 Long Range Laser.\
*Explosion Size 160 ----> 650 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* Named after the '''Sagittarius''' constellation and zodiac sign.\
* While the current model of the '''Sagittarius''' does''' '''resemble the [https://www.halopedia.org/Paris-class_heavy_frigate Paris-Class Heavy Frigate] from Halo series, it more closely resembles the [http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20061023003421/swfanon/images/8/80/Aggressor_destroyer.jpg Aggressor-class Star Destroyer] of the Zann Consortium from Star Wars: Empire at War, Forces of Corruption DLC.\

== Description ==\
The '''Grievion''' is a large [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] that has a total of eight [[Turrets]]. Two are [[Turrets|Medium]] and six are [[Turrets|Small]]. It is mostly grey in color with small faction colored marble pieces, most of which are currently stuck displaying as dark red.\
\
The '''Grievion'''<nowiki/>'s latest model is notable for being much flatter than the original, but with an equally exposed underbelly. The ship has two large engine intakes visible on either side of the cockpit area. Its wings remain in the back and are similar to those of the original model. The top of the command room of the old model is where a [[Turrets|Medium Railgun]] ''used'' to stand.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Grievion's''' interior is split by a ramp up and a ramp down from the entryway. The ramp up and to the left leads to the bridge, while the ramp down and to the right leads to some small living quarters. The bridge has a tall, glowing cylinder with controls directly behind the pilot's seat, which itself has a glowing control panel. In front of the pilot's seat is a set of 3 cargo containers. The living quarters below the bridge has one bed and a small computer. Also, the top window can only be seen through on one side.\
== Advantages ==\
* High firepower.\
* Great hull damage.\
* Good mobility.\
* Six [[Turrets|Small Turrets]] and two [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]] make great pest control.\
* Powerful [[Spinals]] similar to the [[Razor Wing]].\
* Great at PvP, able to fight [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] if the pilot is skilled enough.\
* Good all rounder.\
* Fairly cheap for a Battlecruiser.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Vulnerable bottom.\
* Can be out-gunned by ships with superior armaments.\
== Strategy ==\
* It can take down ships of the same class or below with ease, provided it is able to destroy the ship before it escapes.\
* A good choice of a pirate ship if needing [[Turrets|Medium Turret]] firepower, although the [[Sixfold]] is generally better due to its higher mobility.\
* Use its high mobility to ensure that enemy ships cannot reach its exposed bottom.\
* Use your small and medium turrets to kill smaller ships. Or use your 8 small cannons to eat hull on bigger ships.\
== Version History ==\
* The '''Grievion''' was subject to a major nerf in .47. It had 1 [[Turrets|Railgun]] and 8 [[Spinals|Small Phasers]] removed, as well as a mobility nerf down from 155 / ? / 0.6.\
* Its Speed was further nerfed to 100 in a later version.\
* Received a remodel in .64c.\

==Description==\
The '''Black Scarab''' is a pirate-themed [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] given as a quest reward during the [[Halloween Event 2020]]. It is rather unique among ships in that it is themed after a traditional sea-based vessel rather than a spaceship, as evidenced by its deck, mast, and the ram positioned below the bow. Otherwise, its theming is largely black and red, with smokestacks positioned to the rear of the ship and large banks of thrusters attached to the bottom left and right sides. Pipes can also be seen running along the sides of the ship above a set of smaller fins.\
==Interior==\
The '''Black Scarab''' has a semi-full interior that contains a passageway to and from the AA guns and the entrance, leading up into the helm of the ship. The helm of the ship is very basic with wood paneling, a seat, and a steering column that overlooks the front of the ship. \
==Advantages==\
*One of the fastest [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] in the game at a whopping top speed of 220.\
*High speed combined with above-average health make this ship very resilient against powerful but inaccurate [[turrets]] such as those of most [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super-capitals]]. \
*Very high maneuverability for its class.\
*Can fire all [[turrets]] from up to 7k from a target.\
*Both its [[Turrets|Pirate AAs & Pirate PDLs]] can easily fend off smaller ships, having quick reloads and great accuracy.\
*<s>Your enemies will be jealous of your sweet pirate-ship.</s>\
==Disadvantages==\
*Very expensive, costing a [[Permits|C permit]] when in rotation.\
*Cannot be obtained when out of rotation.\
*Mediocre DPS for a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], lower even than some [[Build Menu|build menu]] [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
*This ship has a very large blind spot underneath, which small ships are going to exploit. \
*Smallest cargo hold out of all [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], at a very meagre 3.\
*Firing all the [[turrets]] at once requires the ship to be below its opponent or tilted downward relative to it, making it a larger target.\
==Strategy==\
*Position yourself somewhat below your enemies to allow usage of all the turrets.\
*Best used as a support/AA due to the high speed of this ship combined with the very accurate guns that can hit up to 7k away.\
*When facing larger opponents, maintain speed and distance to dodge enemy fire and stay in your opponents blindspots.\
*Don't use this ship alone. The [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] status in combination with relatively low DPS make you a major target.\
==Version History==\
*Added teleporters in version .69d\
*Explosion Size 250 ----> 850 .75a12\
*Ship speed 80 ---> 220, Pirate flak range 3k---> 7k and accuracy buffed to 40k, 2 Pirate Lasers changed to 2 Pirate Point Defence Lasers(also have 7k range and 40k accuracy) .???\
==Trivia==\
*The total DPS of this ship used to surpass both the [[Prototype X-1]] and [[Prototype X-2|X-2]] pre super-capital rerelease update.\
*The only [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] to resemble a boat more than a spaceship.\
*Literally a Dreadnought [[Aedes]] according to Revy.\
*The first person to lose this ship first was thedante6 to abc123austinp on 2020-10-30.\

== Description ==\
The '''''Ghost '''''is a [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ship]] that is limited reskin of the old [[Spectre]] model made for the [[Halloween Event 2018]].\
\
This ship excels at being a support ship for Sieges and Fleet battles. It is also good at reconnaissance of enemy fleets due to its fast speed and invisibility on the minimap.\
== Appearance ==\
\
[[File:Ghost-ambience.mp4|thumb|left|Ghost's ambience.]]\
The Ghost shares the same model as the old model of the [[Spectre]] with some key differences, these are: Parts being dislodged from the ship, making it look destroyed, along with a pilot helmet on the front. Near invisibility due to it being a [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ship]]. And an ambience that plays when you are near the ship.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
== Advantages ==\
* Great speed and mobility.\
* Has high firepower for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser.]]\
* Practically invisible and difficult to hit with spinals.\
* Extremely accurate and long range sniper turret.\
* One of the few ships with 100% [[Strategies#Drifting|Drift]] Percentage.\
* Medium Torpedoes have a long range of 10,000 Studs.\
* Rather small size, and flat profile, along with its speed makes it difficult to get hit.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Can be destroyed with little difficulty by ships with precision weapons.\
* Low health for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] and non-existent hull, meaning you are extremely vulnerable to [[Galaxy Slang|shieldbreakers]], especially ones with accurate turrets.\
* Quite difficult to obtain or re-obtain due to costing an [[Permits|E Class Permit]] and [[Stealth Plating]]s.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use your insane speed and the ability to hide to your advantage. Stay in constant motion and drift around your enemies so they do not land shots on you.\
* '''Avoid''' [[Galaxy Slang|shieldbreakers]] like [[Zeus]] as much as possible.\
* This ship is good for Pirating smaller [[Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]].\
* Beware of any explosions from ships you destroy; Your low health will lead to a quick destruction if you don’t pay attention.\
* Always try to hit your spinals, they account for a huge portion of your DPS.\
* Avoid going too close to a Capital Ship, as you will have a hard time hitting your Spinals and their Turrets will shred you.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .65a.\
* Now Stealth. Shield -> 0  Hull -> 1000 Gains custom sniper turret ''(So cold...)'' in an unknown version.\
* Replaced Space Pumpkin cost with [[Stealth Plating]] in version .75a27.\
== Trivia ==\
* Added for the [[Halloween Event 2018]].\
* Used to have a cool particle effect that enshrouds the whole ship, giving it an enigmatic and mysterious like appearance.\
* <s>When people say a ship in Galaxy is broken, show them this ship and make those haters think twice.</s>\
* Images showing Ghost before it was made stealth is found below.\

==Description==\
The '''Cutlass''' features a wide array of [[Turrets]], capable of dealing with both small and large [[Ships]]. It has very low [[Shields|Shield]] health but [[Hull]] health similar to some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]. It is slow but also features Heavy Railguns, which have a long range of 8,000.\
==Appearance==\
TBA\
==Advantages==\
*A good array of Medium, and Large Turrets, allowing combat against a variety of ship classes.\
* One of the few [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] with Heavy Railguns, capable of out-ranging bases and dealing serious Hull damage.\
*High Hull health allows this ship to effectively warp underneath a hostile base which focuses on shield DPS.\
*Cutlass is the tankiest Build Menu Battleship, with its hull alone being the total health of some Battleships.\
==Disadvantages==\
\
*Very slow and sluggish.\
*Poorly defended bottom.\
*Weak to Hull breakers due to low shield health.\
*Poor AA, despite having medium flak cannons they do not offer enough AA for fighting swarms.\
*Can only shoot above it and to its sides, easily divable.\
==Strategy==\
*Use your variety of weapons to support a fleet.\
*Adapt to many situations, as the ships various weapons can support many tasks.\
*Steer clear of [[:Category:Hull breaker|Hull-breakers]] like the [[Avalon]] and ships with high DPS, PVP-Focused armaments like the [[Aegis]].\
*Point your front under your target to make sure your Turrets have a line of sight.\
*Target hulled [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]] as your Heavy Railguns and Large Cannon can cripple them harder and potentially score a kill.\
* Use your Heavy Railguns to out-range a [[Starbase]] during a siege.\
*Useful as a decent hull tank against shield-focused weaponry.\
==Version History==\
*Added in version .65b.\
*Hull increased from 5500 to 6500 in version .66b.\
*Shields reduced from 500 to 250, Hull increased from 6500 to 7750, 3 Small Turrets replaced with 1 Medium Laser, 1 Medium Flak Cannon and 1 Heavy Railgun in version .66b.\
*HP buffed from 2500/5500 to 3000/6000, and 4 armored platings were added to the cost in version .75a\
*Explosion size 110 ----> 330 .75a12\
*Armored Plating cost entirely removed .75a37\
==Trivia==\
*The model was originally submitted as a [[Sagittarius]] remodel.\
*The internal layout and chair positions may remind some people of the interior of the original [[Andromeda]] model.\
*Ship doesn't dock all the way at [[Aqueous II]], as the thrusters block the docking process.\
*Largest Cargo Hold of a normal Battleship.\
* The '''Cutlass''' is essentially the reverse counterpart to the Aegis Battleship; low Shields and an arsenal that focus more on Hull-breaking.\
*The pilot's seat has a [[The Cultists|Cultist]] emblem on it, owing its existence to their shipyards.\
* Has the lowest shield of any Battleship.\
*Currently has the highest total health out of all non-limited Battleships that are in the build menu, although its shield health somewhat defeats the purpose of a jack-of-all-trades ship.\

}}\
== Overview ==\
The '''''Stealth Recon''''' is the smallest stealth ship in the game. It is extremely fast and is equipped with a sniper turret.\
\
This ship excels at being a support ship for Sieges and Fleet battles due to its long range turret and torpedo, as well as having high [[Galaxy Slang|Alpha damage]] for its class. Being in its name, it is also good at reconnaissance of enemy fleets due to its fast speed and invisibility on the minimap.\
== Appearance ==\
The Stealth Recon is a [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ship]], making it's model appear transparent, being nearly invisible in plain sight. The shape of the ship looks similar to [https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/UNSC_Starship Halo Ships] with a long, detailed and slim model. The sniper turret under the ship is extremely large and half the size of the ship.\
\
There is no interior, it is simply a seat that can be accessed from a hatch on top of the ship.\
== Advantages ==\
* High alpha damage, despite only being a [[:Category:Destroyer|destroyer]].\
* Extremely long range.\
* Extremely fast, small size, along with its transparency allows it to evade incoming fire.\
* Cannot be seen on the [[Minimap]] because it is a [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ship]].\
* Lowest detection range of any ship in game.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Very small total health pool for a [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]]\
* Its torpedo, which is its only source of hull-based damage, is difficult to aim.\
* Can be easily hit by point-defense turrets, such as PDLs and Flaks.\
* Slow acceleration for its top speed.\
* Rather sluggish.\
* Sniper turret has a long reload time.\
* Non-existent cargo hold.\
* Expensive for its class, requiring 2 [[Stealth Plating]] to build.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use this ship to harass larger ships with heavy weaponry, such as the [[Judgement]], or to lead AI ships away from firing at your base.\
* Avoid ships such as the [[Hyron]], which are primarily point-defense based, and can somewhat match your speed to keep in range. As well as this, be cautious around heavy point-defense ships such as the [[Ampharos]] or [[Tempest]].\
* With its low detection range and invisibility from the minimap, this ship can be used in its namesake, for reconnaissance.\
* Make sure to never stop moving, as a ship, whether AI controlled or piloted by a player, could easily destroy you in a single volley. If not in immediate danger, slow down slightly to help your sniper turret's accuracy, but never completely stop.\
* Use in swarms to slowly yet effectively siege enemy planets or [[Starbase]]<nowiki/>[[Starbase|s]] by utilizing the sniper turret's long range of 7,500 studs.\
*Whenever you must make an escape from combat; Warp far into empty space ''(but not near the map borders)'' to make your position unpredictable to any enemies that may try to chase you. Note that this strategy may not work well if there is a spy on your team.\
== Version History ==\
* Gained a second tiny torpedo in version .75a5\
== Trivia ==\
* The first player to lose the '''''Stealth Recon''''' was its_loqz, to a [[Dissonance]].\
* The first ship to ever be equipped with a sniper turret.\
* Was removed from the game for 2 hours because yname couldnt make up his mind.\

==Description==\
The '''Cyclops''' was the first siege [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] to be added into the game. It has decent [[Shields]] and 8 Heavy Cannons for shredding [[Hull]]. There is a [[Vanguard Coalition]] logo at the back of the entrance room.\
==Interior==\
When you first enter the interior using a teleporter on the back, you are greeted with a room that has 4 chairs and computers. There is also a large hologram of a planet in the middle of the room. There are two small hallways to the bridge. The seat somewhat resembles that of the old [[Prototype X-2]], but blue.\
==Advantages==\
*Powerful [[Spinals]] do extra Hull damage in addition to [[Turrets]].\
*Fairly flat for its size potentially helping in dodging incoming fire when facing directly away or toward an enemy.\
*Good firing arcs.\
*Great [[Hull]] damage.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Vulnerable bottom.\
*Cannot defend itself from small [[Ships]] too well.\
*Lacks Shield damage\
*Very sluggish mobility, can be outmaneuvered by ships with high maneuverability easily.\
*Performs poorly at PvP due to the sluggish maneuverability and poor overall damage output compared to other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
==Strategy==\
* Use this for finishing off hulled [[Starbase]]s.\
* Try and find an ally with a [[Zeus]] or [[Sagittarius]] as the combination will rip through both Shield and Hull.\
*Can be used to fend off other Dreadnoughts in an anti-siege. The starbase will cripple enemy shields, letting this ship decimate the weakened attackers with its high hull damage.\
==Version history==\
*It received a buff to its [[Spinals]] so that it fires 3 shots instead of just 1.\
*Received a remodel to its interior in .60d1 that gave it an additional second floor.\
*Received another remodel to its interior in .60h that removed its second floor and got remodeled too.\
* The exterior was recolored in .62d2\
*Buffed in .64c, 2 [[Turrets|Railguns]] replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Dual Railguns]], and 1 Railgun removed.\
*.65a5 replaced its weapons with 6 Dual Medium Cannons and 3 Triple Heavy Lasers, giving it an extra Laser Turret.\
*Its Dual Medium Cannons were replaced with single barrel Medium Cannons.\
*Medium Cannons were switched out with Medium Railguns in version .65b.\
*Received another remodel in .65b that looks uncannily similar to an [[Punisher|Alien Punisher]] (and subsequently semi-close to a [[Prototype X-2]]).\
*Replaced 2 of its 3 Heavy Lasers with Triple Heavy Lasers in .66b\
*Replaced 6 Medium Railguns with 6 Dual Medium Cannons in .66b\
*Shields buffed from 4200 to 5200 in .66b\
*Shields buffed from 5620 to 6250 in version .66m.\
*1 Capital Laser changed to 1 Triple Heavy Laser and 6 Triple Heavy Cannons changed to 6 Medium Railguns in version .69a1.\

== Description ==\
The '''3D Printed Warlock''' is a reskin of the [[Warlock]]. The ship is armed with its own special [[Turrets]] called [[Turrets|3D Printed Lasers]] and [[Turrets|3D Printed Railguns]]. The ship is the same as the regular [[Warlock]] except that it is all white to represent 3D printer plastic.\
== Appearance ==\
There is a small teleporter pad that leads to a hallway stretching nearly the entire length of the ship. The hallway has three wider openings with a set of three windows on each side of the openings. The middle opening contains one large pilot's seat and a faction-colored neon screen.\
== Advantages ==\
* Its a ship many don't know about giving an element of surprise.\
* It has an insanely long-ranged [[Turrets]].\
* Custom [[Turrets]] with massive damage.\
* It has high maneuverability for a Battleship.\
* Same speed as most [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] allowing it to outmaneuver a lot of [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and smaller ships.\
* It has a very small blind spot.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* You must buy something from the [https://www.shapeways.com/shops/galaxy-store Galaxy 3D Store].\
* More likely to be targeted due to siege capabilities.\
* Is a high priority target for [[Pirating|Pirates]], and if you lose this ship, '''YOU CANNOT GET IT BACK!'''\
* Very white, making it easier for enemies to see it and aim their [[spinals]].\
* Small Cargo Hold, making it easier for vultures to steal your loot after you siege.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use your insane range and damage to siege bases.\
* Great [[Turrets|Turret]] placement, damage, and range allow for easy destruction of smaller ships, although exercise caution when fighting [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
* '''DO NOT''' use as an everyday ship for battling as you might lose it.\
* During a battle, try to keep your distance.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a class promotion and health nerf in .65b2? that advanced the ship to the [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] class but lowered [[Hull]] and [[Shields]] to 4750 each. Later, its class was returned to Battleship again.\
* Remodeled in version .66k.\
* 3 [[Spinals|Large Cannons]] changed to huge variants in version .69a2.\
* Spinal Large Cannon count increased from 3 to 5 in version .72e1.\
*Explosion size 90 ----> 510 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The first ship to have its own [[Turrets|Railgun]] and [[Turrets|Laser]] sounds.\
* Designed after the actual '''3D Warlock Model''' on the [https://www.shapeways.com/shops/galaxy-store Galaxy 3D store].\
* DJFancehFeast was the first person to lose this ship in combat. It was lost during a skirmish between the Galaxy Factions called [[The Holy Kryuvian Empire]], De Nexus Empire, and [[The Cultists]].\
* Was accidentally released for around 50k credits on March 28, 2020. It was found during a mining run the Blackhawks were doing in a vip server. At least 35 '''3D Printed Warlocks''' were bought in this vip server.\
* Was unintentionally released again for around 200k credits on July 7, 2021. It is unknown how many were purchased.\

==Description==\
The '''Draco''' is a very fast [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] that has a limited damage output. It is well known for its speed and its ability to distract [[ships]] without high-accuracy defense. It has both [[Spinals|Phasers]] and [[Spinals|Cannons]], making it effective against [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] health.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Draco''' has a detailed interior space for a ship its size. Its cockpit has two control joysticks and a screen display in front of the pilot's seat. The seat itself is lacking in detail aside from the angled back and separate colors.\
==Advantages==\
*Insanely fast frigate.\
*The speed and shape make it hard to hit, especially for larger [[ships]].\
*[[Spinals]] have a high rate of fire.\
*Great for distracting a base during a siege.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Extremely weak [[Spinals]].\
*No [[Turrets]].\
*Minuscule Cargo Hold.\
==Strategy==\
*Get a large group of these and use them to swarm larger targets.\
*Use its high fire rate to heavily damage targets.\
*When diving, fire 2-3 volleys, turn around and repeat to avoid incoming fire and to avoid getting too close to [[Starbase|bases]].\
*Use it to distract [[Starbase|bases]] while other big ships are sieging it, or attack ships that are sieging your [[Starbase|base]].\
*Avoid ships with a lot of Light [[Turrets]] or [[Turrets|Gatlings]] in order to prevent damage.\
*In dogfighting, keys Q, E, A, & D, your speed, and your tiny spinal weaponry are your friends. Strafe and drift to land more hits on smaller [[ships]].\
== Version History ==\
* Was disabled during parts of version .62 due to model errors.\
* The [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass]] was needed for the Draco, but as of .62b?, the [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] is no longer limited to [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] players only.\
* Received a nerf to its Cargo Hold on .65a3.\
* Received a nerf in .65a? removing 15 speed and halving the total spinal count (two tiny cannons/phasers).\
* Recolored in version .65b.\
* Received a remodel in version .67c.\
==Trivia==\
* The description has various grammatical errors, including the usage of the wrong \"its.\"\
* There was a short time period after its release in which it required [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] to build. However, after remodeling its [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] was removed.\
* The new model was programmed with 4 [[Spinals|Phasers]] and 4 [[Spinals|Cannons]], but an implementation bug forced all 4 of each weapon to fire simuntaneously, appearing as if only 2 of each [[Spinals|Spinal]] were firing.\
*The Shipmaster Lordmonkeymonkey called out the ship's builder, FangABXY, claiming that he was the cause of the [[ships]] bugs; including its remodel making the [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] tab unusable and its [[Spinals]] aiming sideways.\
* The current model's description was changed almost entirely, changing the species name referenced from Drakodem to Manjin, and speaking more in detail of the exact components of the ship.\
*Its interior shares the control sticks with the [[Archangel]] and [[Worm]].\
**Its pilot seat is similar to the [[Archangel]].\
*There is a Halloween reskin of the '''Draco''', the [[Dragon]].\
*The Draco's description says it has 4 phasers and 4 cannons, despite having only 2 phasers and 1 cannon because of balance reasons.\

== Description ==\
The '''United States of Razor''' is quite known for its ability to take on larger ships, making it good for [[Pirating]] and [[Starbase]] defense. The '''United States of Razor''' is a reskin of the old [[Razor Wing]]. This ship was originally only available for 1–2 days during the President's Day Event, but then it was re-released over two years later on the Independence Day Event 2020.\
== Appearance ==\
The general layout of the interior is the same as the [[Razor Wing]]. There is a small energy core pillar directly inside from the gangplank, and a set of six chairs leading to the front cockpit, which itself has a black pilot's seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Powerful [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal weaponry]] for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
* Has the same Top Speed and Turn Speed as the Razor Wing.\
*Decent health.\
*Extremely high explosion radius, the highest out of all battlecruisers (for reference, the explosion radius is 10 less than [[Nyx]]/[[Borealis]]).\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No high [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
* Vulnerable bottom.\
* Limited, meaning that unless it is on rotation in the Limited build menu, you cannot get it back. Additionally, it costs a (D?) class permit, which can be difficult to acquire.\
* More expensive than the Razor Wing, which to put it in perspective, the player needs 22 and a third (1/3) times the price of the Razor Wing to build the United States of Razor.\
== Strategy ==\
* You can shoot bigger ships with its powerful [[Spinals|Spinal]] weapons.\
* Treat this as a trophy. Never use it and only spawn it to show off to other players.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a nerf that removed its [[Turrets|Flak Cannons]] in an unknown version\
* Received a buff on its July 4th re-release, gaining two additional medium cannons as well as two small patriotic Gatling turrets. Also received a remodel in an unknown version.\
*Reclassed from [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] to [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] and explosion size increased from ? to 400 in version .69e.\
*Spinal interval reduced: 0.2 -> 0.1 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* This ship is one of the few, if not the only to play actual music (compared to sound effects). When spawned, it plays Hail to the Chief and other patriotic music.\
\
* This ship has the highest cargo hold of any battlecruiser.\
* This ship has about 13x the cargo hold of the [[Razor Wing]], essentially making this ship a backup [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] if needed.\
* This ship has 500 more [[Shields]] and 600 more [[Hull]] than the [[Razor Wing]]\
* One of the first remodeled, limited event ships to cost more than 2x the value of the original ship (currently about 10x - 12x the price of the [[Razor Wing]]).\
\
* It uses the colors of the American flag, which symbolizes freedom and capitalism.\
* The [[Razor Wing]] lost 4 rounds of its [[Spinals]], while this ship kept them.\
* This ship used to not have the famous asymmetric 'wing' that the [[Razor Wing]] has, possibly due to the lack of 'wing' in the name. The model was updated before or during the 2020 4th of July event to include the asymmetric wing.\
* Was one of the rarest ships in-game as it was not re-released during the Black Friday event; however, it has been re-released on July 4th, 2020, diminishing its rarity, and is now on a randomized rotation in the Limited build menu.\

\
==Description==\
The '''''Mothership''''' is the strongest (and most tanky) [[Starbase]] in the game. You are able to upgrade it to level 5 and it even has its own custom [[Turrets]]. At level 5, these build up to a massive arsenal of 8 [[Turrets|Mothership Miniguns]], 4 [[Turrets|Mothership Lasers]], 2 [[Turrets|Mothership Cannons]], 6 [[Turrets|Mothership Railguns]] and 1 [[Turrets|Mothership Large Railgun]]. It has a total of 40,000 health without upgrades. 20,000 shield and 20,000 hull. It has a <u>'''massive explosion size'''</u>.\
\
A friendly warning to the community:\
\
'''<u>Nearly everyone</u>''' underestimates the explosion size of the mothership and lost their ship to its explosion. Mothership's explosion radius for each level are 1000, 1300, 1690, 2197 and 2857 respectively, which is a whopping 28570 studs at max level so be sure to '''<u>warp far, far away</u>''' from it when it explodes.\
\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Mothership''' had been ready to be added to the game for a while before the update launched.\
* The '''Mothership''' CANNOT be captured via shooting it like a planet. This will destroy it, as it is listed as a normal NPC base, and behaves much like the [[Freedom Base]] or the [[Derelict Station]].\
* Its death sound is loud, even louder than the old [[Abandoned U.N.E Base|UNE Starbase]] Alarm.[[File:Mothership Alarm.ogg|thumb|Loud Mothership alarm|none]]\
* The explosion is so powerful that it has the highest explosion radius at max level (2857 explosion radius).\
* It is the first of any upgrade-capable base to have a Level 5 upgrade.\
* The '''Mothership''' closely resembles the original [[Cyclops]].\
* There is a large blindspot at the rear of the '''Mothership'''. If you are an enemy and stay at the rear of the '''Mothership''', the '''Mothership''' will start attacking itself in an attempt to hit your ship. This, however, will not damage the '''Mothership'''.\
* There was an admin version of the '''Mothership''' while it was being designed.\
* There used to be a screen in the [[Mega Base]] that referenced the '''Mothership'''.\
* For whatever reason unknown, whether it be better ships or a lesser explosion, the Mothership death seems to be less deadly as of version .66b. Compared to before when it could kill a full health leviathan, a Lucifer can take the explosion from 8.5k studs away and only have half of its shield removed.\
* There is a teleporter in the unconstructed part of the mothership. The use is unknown as it functions like trying to go in the door of the kneall embassy, sending you to the Mega Base. If truly needed, this place can be used as a last ditch effort for despawning a ship.\
* A fair amount of people out there may want to do something called a 'revenge kill' on the Mothership, most often meaning that the Mothership explosion destroyed their (possibly expensive) ship at least once.[[File:Screenshot (80).png|left|thumb]][[File:Me taking a mothership explosion - Galaxy - Roblox|thumb|301x301px]]\

== Description ==\
'''Myriad III''' is the smallest and weakest planet in Galaxy. It has a brown atmosphere and a desert-covered surface. The planet is also covered in the ruins of an [[Aliens|Alien]] facility and some crashed Alien ships. Small groups of Alien Script can also be seen throughout the facility. Inside the facility is a small, damaged doorway that leads downwards into a series of tunnels.\
\
Whichever faction's territory covers the planet first assimilates the planet as their own. Whoever brings down the planet's health to zero will take over '''Myriad III'''.\
\
'''Myriad III''' can be upgraded twice. The first upgrade (Level 2) costs 12,000 credits and adds 1000 health to both Shield and Hull, adds some visual changes around and inside the facility, adds a ladder to the [[Alien Computer]], adds teleporters from the docking ports to the facility, and adds one medium railgun. The second upgrade (Level 3) costs 24,000 credits and adds 1000 more health to both Shield and Hull, adds a new hangar on the surface that releases [[Swarmer Prototype]]s, adds further visual changes to the facility/surface, and adds 8 custom heavy railguns.\
== Climate ==\
The climate of '''Myriad III''' is a hot desert with constant sandstorms covering the planet. No life exists on the planet, and the abandoned buildings suggest that the planet had a large alien facility, possibly a refinery or research station.\
== Duna'kaé ==\
During part three of the Celestial Bodies update(s), a moon was added in orbit of '''Myriad. '''The moon is named ''\"Duna'kaé\"'' and is supposedly the home of a dormant (or inactive) volcano. The moon's volcanic activity and excessive heat have left the surface flat and tough. The moon has a similar atmosphere to '''Myriad''', but it is a bright red as opposed to '''Myriad's''' brown. '''Myriad'''<nowiki/>'s moon ''Duna'kaé'' also contains a [[Richard Kavar|Quest]] which requires you to obtain 5 Data Archives, a very rare and expensive artifact that can be found drifting through space in random locations or bought at the [[Mega Base]]. Most players with access to mid-tier miners should be able to afford them if bought. The reward for completing this quest is only 15,000 credits, so most players do not do it, as Artifacts are very rare items.\
=== Climate ===\
The climate of ''Duna'kaé'' is very hot and is unable to support life.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in version .60d1\
* Received a moon named \"Duna'kaé\" in version .62d2\
* Received a remodel in version .66b.\
* Received turrets for level 2 and 3 in version .66b.\
* Gained Heavy Lasers/Cannons and Huge Railguns in version .73b3\
== Trivia ==\
* The first planet in the game to have an alien facility.\
* The first planet to have a moon.\
* Has the second lowest shield of any base, the first being the Abandoned U.N.E Base.\
* There are crab decals hidden across the planet.\
* Formerly the only planet to spawn fighters—the addition of fighters to [[Frion I|Frion I's]] Lucifer Station ended that part of Myriad's uniqueness.\
* Formerly the only planet to gain no turrets when upgraded.\
* Secret text in the underground hallway translates to Lightning9160, a modeler for Galaxy.\
* If a ship is small enough, it can fit in the middle area, effectively making it a blindspot__NOTOC__\

To enter the '''Constellation's '''interior, step on a teleportation pad located on the back of the ship. Once you are inside, you will be greeted by a slate grey slightly rectangular room with a black \"pilot's seat\" (brick) in the middle of the room.\
== Advantages ==\
* Large cargo hold.\
* Can easily make large amounts of [[Credits]] per run given a good economy.\
* High [[Hull]] and [[Shields]].\
* Good acceleration.\
* The only armed freighter in the game.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* The ship's large width and relatively slow speed make you a prized target for [[Pirating|Pirates]] using bigger [[Ships]].\
* Expensive and requires VIP.\
* While this ship is armed, the armament is so weak that it can hardly defend itself from an experienced [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] pilot.\

* Received a remodel in version .65a.\
* Received two Point Defense Lasers in version .66b.\
*Turn Speed increased from 0.13 to 0.2 and Cargo Hold increased from 5000 to 5500 in version .70a.\
*All [[Turrets]] removed in version .71b.\

== Trivia ==\
* One of the only freighters in-game to have armament.\
* In etymology, the name is the word for a group of stars that form a pattern in the sky.\
* It was the 2nd [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] ship to be temporarily available to all players before being restricted to [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] players only.\
* You used to be able to unconventionally destroy other [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] ships in the '''Constellation'''. Technically, you could even raid a base or a planet!\
* It was one of the four [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] with [[Turrets]], the other being the [[Patriotic Hercules]], [[Carvainir]] and the [[C Class]].\
* Although it was supposed to be the first armed [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]], the [[Carvainir]] was designed for the same purpose. The Carvainir however, was classed as a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] due to its high firepower.\
* The remodel made it significantly smaller and harder to hit.\

==Description==\
The '''Retro Nyx''' is a limited version of the original [[Nyx]] featuring the ship's old model, and [[Retro Nixesion|original fighters]], some of the stats are somewhat different than the Nyx (e.g. higher speed, higher total health, etc.).\
==Appearance==\
The Retro Nyx is a large, long, flat carrier that is identical to the iconic first model of the [[Nyx]]. \
\
A teleporter at the back leads to bridge, which contains the pilot seat, and the teleporter to the hangar.\
\
The '''Fighter Bay''' is a long hangar housing 12 [[Nyxesion]] fighters and a door leading to the <u>'''Interior'''</u> that contains 10 seats for players and the teleporter to the bridge.\
==Advantages==\
* Huge total health, at 28000 total health (and the damage resistance of 55%).\
* Relatively high acceleration, turn speed, and top speed for it's class.\
* Relatively high Cargo Hold (1000).\
* Large death explosion can easily destroy all smaller ships in range (~5000 studs).\
*One of the highest DPS carriers in the game with fighters, standing at a monstrous 1367.26 DPS, rivalling that of [[Ghoul Nyx]] and [[Kapisi]].\
*One of the best ships for sieging bases and destroying large capital ships with its fighter swarm.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Players can easily swarm an undefended '''Retro''' '''Nyx'''.\
* Extremely large.\
*Huge blindspot underneath the ship and a small blindspot behind the ship.\
* Very expensive, costing over 540k credits and a B class permit.\
*Without its fighters, it is almost unable to fight any ships that it engages, making it defenseless, even with its enormous health.\
* Will be hunted due to being a limited ship.\
* Low turret DPS compared to other limited carriers.\
* Very expensive to fill up its fighter's with AI pilots costing 3000 robux without VIP to fill.\
\
==Strategy==\
* Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.\
*'''Never''' overestimate the ship's health, as a coordinated fleet could easily shred your ship.\
*It can be used as a support [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] in sieges by carrying [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to distract enemy [[Starbase]]s, as well as providing great support from its large fighter swarm.\
* The Retro Nyx can be used as a decent tank as it has more health than some [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] ships but this is not recommended as the Retro Nyx is a limited carrier and will be targeted and hunted.\
*Warp in, release fighters, then immediately warp back to your strongest starbase.\
*Extremely powerful in taking down NPC Bosses.\
==Version History==\
*Turnspeed reduced from 0.25 to 0.17, Health reduced from 16500/14500 to 13500/12000 in version .73a3\
*Retro Heavy Laser count reduced from 3 to 2 in version .73a3.\
*Health increased from 13500/12000 to 16000/12000 after the event ended.\

The '''''Naglfar''''' is a [[:Category:Dreadnought|'''Dreadnought''']] with high maneuverability and speed.\
\
==Description==\
The Naglfar is a Dreadnought with a rather balanced loadout and very high maneuverability that allows it to be a decent ship against brawling other Capital Ships.\
==Appearance==\
The '''Naglfar''' has a long and thin profile for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]. It has a mostly grey colour with numerous armored details around the ship. Its most prominent features are its extremely large spinal barrel, which spans almost half of the ship, and its two big fins on the back of the ship. In the middle there can be found a small airlock door, and below that door is the text, '''''\"''DEATH TO UNE''\"''''', similar to the one found on [[Nimitz]].\
\
Its interior is just a grey box.\
==Advantages==\
*Higher than average health.\
*Very high maneuverability, with a turn speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turn_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Naglfar'}}.\
*Decent for brawling against other Capital Ships and for defense against [[Sieging|Sieges]].\
*Can inflict high damage against hull with its Hull DPS of 300+.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Large [[Galaxy Terminology|Blindspots]] on the bottom and the back of the ship.\
*Bad [[Turrets|Turret]] placement against [[Ships]] below its class.\
*Deals low damage against shields.\
*Not much defense against small ships aside from its 2 Vulcan Turrets.\
==Strategy==\
*Get in front your target at all times to ensure the best lines of sight for your turrets.\
*Staying at mid range and firing using your Heavy Lasers will help to easily fight Dreadnoughts.\
*Have teammates with shield breaking ships to offset your low shield damage.\
*It handles better than most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], but always be on alert.\
*Due to your lower Hull health, you must be careful when your shield becomes depleted.\
*If there are any base defenders, focus on them first. They pose a greater risk to you and your fleet than the [[Starbase]].\
*Never tank in a siege. A Starbase would make short work of your shields.\
*Work closely with your team when defending, especially if one of your teammates is in a ship that's excellent against shield to put ships out of action for a long repair, if not outright destroy them.\
==Version History==\
*Remodeled in .61h1\
*Shield health raised to 7000, Spinal size increased to huge and given an extra cannon barrel in version .68e.\
*2 Capital Triple Lasers and 1 Triple Heavy Laser changed to 1 Triple Heavy Cannon and 2 Dual Medium Cannons in version .69a1.\
*Explosion Size 500 ----> 590 .75a12\
*Remodeled in an unknown version.\
==Trivia==\
*Has the same text \"Death To UNE\" as the one found on [[Nimitz]].\
*Had one of the most remodels, at a count of 4 Remodels.\
*It was once the cheapest Dreadnought to buy before its recent buff.\

== Description ==\
A PvP [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]], the '''Katana''' was made with high [[Shields|Shield]] and smaller [[turrets]] to allow for PvP accuracy. It shares its primary model shape with the [[Plagued Warship]], with a set of four arced arms near the back of the ship and a wide but somewhat flat front that tapers to a somewhat more square point. Its turrets are largely top-mounted with a cannon placed in the middle-front and four gatling cannons spaced around the edges and mid-rear area.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Katana's''' interior is a small undecorated square with a teleporter, a normal chair with a keyboard in front of it, and a strangely drawn and spread-out rectangle.\
== Advantages ==\
* Fast for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]\
* Great [[Shields|Shield]]-breaker.\
* Agile for a battleship.\
* High Shield health.\
* The '''Katana's''' 5 [[Turrets|Gatling Cannons]] can take out small [[Ships]] very well.\
*The '''Katana's''' 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] can take out hull-based ships like [[Marauder]] and [[Cutlass]].\
* Powerful Shield-breaking [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] that fire in a \"shotgun\" pattern.\
*The \"shotgun\" Spinal pattern of the Katana makes it easier to aim spinals while dealing enormous damage in close combat.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Must be facing towards target to fire all [[Turrets]].\
* Somewhat low Hull for a battleship.\
* Has trouble docking at certain points (Aqueous II and Christmas Mega Base docks A-D)\
* Requires [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] aiming in order to deal effective Shield damage.\
* If you fight against a shield-breaker, you will be at a mediocre disadvantage.\
*Somewhat low maximum range if you exclude the Spinals.\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship is great for [[Pirating]]. Warp to your target, kill it, and warp back.\
* Watch your health when using the '''Katana''' because you may need to warp out while still on [[Shields|Shield]] (~2000).\
* Try to use '''Katana''' more in a fleet than alone because of its low health.\
* If you are fighting against a small ship and you can't hit it with your spinals, do yourself a favor and warp away. Your turrets will take a while to hull the target.\
* Try to use this ship together with a Hull-breaker ship, most of the dps from this ship is targeted to the shields.\
* Use your spinals, as they skyrocket your combined dps from 80 to 394.7 (not including damage shield boosts or any other damage boosts)(DPS amount has been fixed.)\
* Don't take risks during war, especially if your warring a strong faction, as they can easily swarm and kill you.\
== Version History ==\
* Buffed in .66b, making its shield go from 4000 to 4500 and its two Dual Medium Cannons became two Triple Heavy Cannons.\
* [[Shields]] reduced to 3500 in version .69a1.\
*2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] and 1 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Cannon]] changed to 3 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]], 1 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Cannon]] removed and received a remodel in version .69f.\
*Top Speed reduced from 100 to 90, [[Hull]] increased from 1000 to 2000, 3 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] and 1 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Cannon]], [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] firing interval reduced from 0.1 to 0 and Spinals received minor firing offset in version .69f.\
*Plating no longer has the team color on it .72e1\
*Explosion size 25 ----> 270 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The old model looks a lot like an undersized [[Prototype X-2]].\
* The current model is the old [[Genesis]] model.\

== Description ==\
The '''Frostpocalypse''' is a redesign of the [[Apocalypse]] [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]. It was released on December 20th, 2018, when the [[Christmas Event 2018]] update came out.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Frostpocalypse''' has an interior similar to the interior of the regular [[Apocalypse]]'s old model. The only difference being wooden seats, and 2 smaller screens on the side of the large screen of the pilot's seat reading: :Frost Levels: Frosty\", and \"Current List: Naughty\".\
== Advantages ==\
* Great amount of health for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] along with 50% damage resistance.\
* High [[Turrets|Turret]] DPS.\
*Insane alpha of over 4500 to both [[Shields]] and [[Hull]] rivals most [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]].\
* Has a large cargo hold for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
* Can be used to siege [[Starbase]]s from afar.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Difficult to attack or defend itself against ships smaller or faster than it.\
* Just like the [[Apocalypse]], the ship is weak to attacks directed towards its backside.\
*Slower maneuverability than it's [[Apocalypse|regular counterpart]].\
* Once you lose this ship, '''YOU CANNOT GET IT BACK!''' (unless refunded)\
*[[Pirating|Pirates]] (player) are more likely to target you because of the fact that the '''Frostpocalypse''' is extremely rare.\
== Strategy ==\
*PvP other large ships with your fleet and stay close to the front lines, enabling your team to attack from the sides or support from afar.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .65b.\
* The [[Turrets|Large Railguns]] got nerfed and were replaced by [[Turrets|Medium Railguns]] in an unspecified version.\
* [[Shields|Shield]] increased to from 6900 to 7200 and [[Hull]] increased from 7000 to 7250 in an unknown version.\
*Explosion Size 750 ----> 800 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* Added during the [[Christmas Event 2018]].\
* Most expensive Event Ship in the [[Christmas Event 2018]].\
* Even though it is the most expensive ship in the event, the [[Frozen MRLS Launcher]] still required more [[Snowflake]]s.\
* Between the '''Frostpocalypse''', and its normal buildable counterpart, the [[Apocalypse]] [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]; the '''Frostpocalypse''' comes ahead in health by 2980 health (1180 [[Shields]] and 1800 [[Hull]]), Cargo Hold by 1660, and stronger [[Turrets]]. However, it falls short of 0.04 Turnspeed and 2 acceleration.\
* [https://www.roblox.com/users/505347830/profile Specimen_1374] was the first player to kill a '''Frostpocalypse. '''The '''Frostpocalypse''' killed belonged to [https://www.roblox.com/users/37173813/profile epictom11].\
* [https://www.roblox.com/users/33641196/profile Rocket_GotG] was the first player to purchase the '''Frostpocalypse''' and also the first to make a video of it when '''Frostpocalypse '''had 6 [[Turrets|Crystal Heavy Rails]] before nerf.\
* It still retains the old [[Apocalypse]] model (apart from the festive alterations)\

\
It mines as fast as the [[Advanced Miner]] and [[Industrial Miner]]. Its total health of 1800 divides evenly between [[Hull]] and [[Shields]] (900/900). Takes a minimum of 120 seconds to fill up its Ore Hold.\
== Appearance==\
The '''Harvester''' has no interior other than a simple pilot's seat set against a slanted gray wall.\
== Advantages ==\
* High mobility.\
* Small, making it hard to hit.\
* Decent speed.\
* The [[Turrets|Medium Mining Laser]] provides a considerable range, and the [[Turrets|Tiny Mining Lasers]] allow short-range harvesting.\
* Very affordable [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low health pool.\
* Small Ore Hold.\
* Slow Acceleration and Deceleration.\
* [[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miner-class ships]].\

* Watch out if you're at [[War]], you're likely to be ambushed.\
* Don't mine at the [[Mega Base]] if you are at [[War]] and you aren't protected.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a remodel in version .56b.\
* Nerfed in an unknown version, losing 175 Cargo Hold.\
* As of .61i, its [[Turrets|Mining Lasers]] now mine [[Ores]] as far as 3000 studs, the original distance of [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]].\
* Received a buff in .64a? that upgraded its two [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] into 1 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Laser]].\
* Received a buff in .64f that added 2 [[Turrets|Tiny Mining Lasers]] and upped its Ore Hold from 750 to 900.\
* Received a buff in .66b that buffed its 2 [[Turrets|Tiny Mining Lasers]] to 2 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]]. Its speed also increased to 225 while also receiving a buff to its Ore Hold, making it 1150.\
*Buff reverted in .66b?: Ore Hold was 900, Cargo Hold was 90.\
*In an unknown version, its Ore Hold was buffed to 1000 and Cargo Hold was buffed to 100.\
*Alongside the [[Advanced Miner]], this ship was put off sale in version .75a10.\
== Trivia ==\
* The creator of the ship once called for the ship to be renamed, but it was refused. Had he been successful, this ship would be known as the Flevyrion.\
* Brings in about 937 credits without any [[Loyalty]] per run, but can earn up to 1687 credits.\
* Has a cult following in the Galaxy Community (Harvesterism).\
* Was the first ever [[:Category:Miner|Miner-class ship]] to have a [[Warp Drive]].\
* According to the U.N.E lore, an off-course '''Harvester''' discovered [[Aqueous II|Aqueous ll]].\
* The second of two [[:Category:Miner|Miner-class ships]] to have [[Turrets|Tiny Mining Lasers]], with the [[Woolly Mammoth]] being the first [[:Category:Miner|Miner-class ship]] to ever have [[Turrets|Tiny Mining Lasers]].\
* Was shadowed by the [[Hornet]] for a while, due to it being better in nearly all aspects.\
* Before it was buffed, it had only 2 [[Turrets|Tiny Mining Lasers]].\
* The largest [[:Category:Miner|Miner-class ship]] you can buy with a level one warehouse.\

"Ship_Loss","== Description ==\
Losing ships is an annoying and frustrating event. Here are some tips on how to avoid ship loss, and some specific scenarios that may lead to ship loss. However, since a recent update, you get a partial refund through \"[[Galactic Insurance]]\" if your ship is destroyed. Players receive 20% material value for combat ships, and 40% for [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]].\
\
== Golden Rules ==\
The [[Golden Rules]] are a set of tips and general advice that players can follow to help avoid ship loss.\
\
== Specific Scenarios that lead to Ship Loss ==\
''Note that all of these scenarios fall within the general category of ship loss by PvP, excluding the case of being AFK.''\
\
===Baited===\
* In this scenario, a member of your [[Player Factions|Faction]] tells you to go somewhere, claiming they will protect you. However, instead of protecting you, the player organizes a huge squad of enemy ships at your [[Warp Drive|Warp]] endpoint. This strategy is uncommon, but can be effective against inexperienced players.\
\
===Overconfidence===\
* Some players, especially after creating a new, more powerful [[Ships|Ship]], are not aware of the strategy or risks involved in using the new ship. As such, they are more likely to be reckless or challenge people. Often, these people will end up with a ship loss or someone will take their \"kill\". This is a somewhat common way to lose [[Ships]], especially with [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
===AFK===\
* This scenario simply involves a player looking away from the game for too long, and they neglect to notice that their ship is under fire. This can happen quite often with [[Aliens|Alien]] or NPC attacks, and some players have lost extremely expensive [[Ships]] in this unfortunate manner.\
\
===Team Bail===\
* In this scenario, ships are in a siege/squad, and team members suddenly leave without warning. The unfortunate player that is last to leave is often quickly swarmed by enemies that take advantage of the confusion.\
\
===Lag===\
* This was a particularly painstaking way to die before the warp system revamp. In previous versions of Galaxy, the game would become extremely laggy when warships were spawned. Unfortunately, as more ships were spawned to attack or siege, the server lag would increase. The previous [[Warp Drive|Warp]] systems were extremely vulnerable to lag, and many ships were lost because people couldn't accelerate to maximum warp fast enough. Many people try to appeal this type of ship loss, but are turned down due to rules or a lack of evidence. This can also act as a precursor to a complete disconnection from the game. Ships remain spawned for ~90 seconds when a player leaves, making the ship completely vulnerable to enemy fire in that time frame. Often, this is plenty long enough for a ship to be destroyed.\
\
===Flung===\
* [[Ships]] are flung when the [[Warp Drive|Warp]] system goes haywire or when the ship is warped into a solid object, causing glitches that fling players outside of the map boundaries. In earlier versions of Galaxy, being outside of map boundaries caused constant damage to ship shields and hull. It is also effectively impossible to warp while outside of the map boundaries, making them a dangerous place to get stuck, especially for ships with low maneuverability. Sometimes, big ships like [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] can get stuck in the vertical border if flung, causing the ship to be unable to move or warp out. The only way to fix this is to reset and wait for the cooldown.\
\
=== Dock Blocked ===\
* '''DOCK BLOCKING IS A BANNABLE OFFENSE.''' In this scenario, another ship, regardless of [[Player Factions|Faction]], attempts to or blocks another ship from being able to fully dock and despawn, thus leaving it vulnerable to enemy fire. Provided players have evidence, ships lost in this way are often refundable, and the offender may be banned for violation of the [[Galaxy Rules]].\
\
=== Border Ambush ===\
* When you are just wandering near the border or running for your life, a random ship hidden from the mini map border close to you will come and cripple you. These ambushes are usually [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], and [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]]. Another way they do this is they [[Warp Drive|Warp]] along the border toward your location. This is a pretty uncommon way to lose your ship, but it happened to somebody because a [[Prototype X-1]] was hiding in the border.\

== Description ==\
The '''Hasatan''' has a thin front that expands to a set of blast wings and wider thrusters on the rear.\
\
It has a Torpedo tube-like decoration that houses a [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Torpedo]].\
== Appearance ==\
The entrance has a teleporter that teleports the player to the pilot room which has three seats. The seat on the back is the pilot seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Relatively low cost.\
* Good health pool.\
* High damage per shot and long range(11,000 studs) with the [[Spinals|Large Torpedo]], at 750 damage.\
* Great overall [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower.\
* Decent long-range [[Turrets|Turret]] armament.\
* Overall good damage output.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Long [[Spinals|Torpedo]] reloading time.\
* A large target that is easily hit by [[Turrets|Large Turrets]].\
* The extremely slow speed of the [[Spinals|Torpedo]] makes fighting almost impossible, short of [[Starbase]]s and large [[ships]].\
* Underwhelming maneuverability for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* Ineffective against smaller, faster [[Ships]].\
* Relies on the [[Turrets|Super LR Laser]] and the [[Spinal Weaponry|Phasers]] for [[Shields|shield]] damage.\
== Strategy ==\
* It is an excellent alternative to conventional [[:Category:Siege Ship|Siege Ships]], being cheaper and also capable of dealing high damage to bases from a long range.\
* Be sure to get far enough from the base because the health is too low to tank for more than 30 seconds.\
* Use [[:Category:PVP Ship|PVP ships]] as escorts, along with another '''Hasatan''' for constant assault.\
* Try to get away if any ships come towards you. A [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] can even kill you if you have no support.\
* Very effective with the \"[[Strategies|Outside The Box]]\" tactic.\
* Can be good against [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] if it's constantly on its blind spots. However, it's bad against any ships smaller or faster than a Battleship.\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled in version .61d.\
* Received a buff in .66b increasing its [[Shields|Shield]] from 2500 to 3000, its [[Hull]] from 2000 to 3000, increasing the [[Spinals|Torpedo]] size from large to huge, and revamping the [[Turrets|Turret]] loadout. It was also remodeled.\
* 1 [[Turrets|Long Range Laser]] and 3 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] removed in version .69a1.\
*2 [[Turrets|Long Range Lasers]] replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Medium Railguns]] in version .69e, due to Long Range Laser (not the Heavy LR Laser) turret being removed from the game.\
*1 [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Torpedo]] downsized to large variant in version .71b.\
*2 Medium Phasers upgraded to 2 Large Phasers in unknown version.\
*Shield health increased from 3,300 to 4,300, 1 Heavy LR Laser replaced with 1 Super LR Laser, and 2 Medium Railguns replaced with 2 Medium Siege Railguns in version .75a5.\
*Explosion size 60 ----> 275 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* In theory, it can kill a base without the base ever firing back. In practice, though, unless it is guarded, it will die easily to enemy defenders.\
* It used to have a glitch with one of its [[Turrets]], resulting in a [[Turrets|Turret]] that is inside the ship.\
* The [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Torpedo]] does high damage, so it's a very popular ship for [[Sieging]].\
* The first '''Hasatan''' model heavily resembled a CR-90 Corvette from Star Wars.\
* Somewhat Resembles the [[Theia]].\

==Description==\
The '''Hercules''' is a trading ship that has a large cargo hold. It docks with the back of the ship facing the base, and the entrance is a semitransparent door in the back with a bridge leading to it. It has 4 engines on the back. There are 13 containers leading to the front of the ship.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Hercules''' is contained inside a small room jutting up from the main ship body. Most of the interior is taken up by an empty hallway leading to the bridge. The bridge has three seats and a screen for each seat. The center seat is the pilot's seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* The '''Hercules''' has a large cargo hold with 2500 cargo space, allowing a player to make large profits in a single run. It can also salvage multiple wrecks without having to dock before continuing to loot, depending on the wrecked ship.\
* This ship is great for transferring items into your [[Warehouse]].\
* Decent amount of health.\
* Explosion Radius of 40\
* Fast for a freighter of its size, making it a great ship for looting wreckage fields.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* The '''Hercules''' has a quite slow turn speed of 0.30, making it a bit of a process to aim towards wrecks and '''Starbases'''.\
\
* [[Pirating|Pirates]] consider a '''Hercules''' a high-value target because they are slow and can be easy targets.\
* Despite its description, it can be destroyed by capable pilots.\
* Has dark tinted windows, making it difficult to aim for a precise warp sometimes.\
==Strategy==\
* Make sure to trade in a Faction that is in no [[War]]s and has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have [[War|Wars,]] try your best to be safe.\
* Go to the [[Mega Base]] when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a [[War]], there might be a pirate waiting for you.\
* Check how far away the closest [[Aliens|Alien]] is and where it is heading to.\
* Make sure to retreat to the nearest ally base if a war is declared on your faction.\
* You could use this to vulture swiftly and get out before pirates can get to you.\
==Version History==\
* The Hercules has had 3 remodels during its existence. The 1st and 2nd ones were the most similar, having the same fish-like design.\
* Buffed in .65b - Shield increased from 1500 to 2000, Cargo Hold increased from 1500 to 2750, price increased significantly. Also received a remodel.\
*Speed increased in unknown version - from 65 studs a second to 80 studs a second.\
*Price increased in .75a5 - from Silicate: 965, Carbon: 596, Iridium: 245, to Silicate: 3365, Carbon: 1846, Iridium: 1295.\
*The cargo hold was increased by 500, from 2,500 to 3,000 in version .75a10.\
== Trivia ==\
* The old '''Hercules'''' bottom floor was large enough to contain a small fighter.\
* Its old design is based on the ''Hercules'' from StarCraft II.\
* Prior to the remodel, the '''Hercules''' had a small secret compartment in the entrance to the ship. This may have been a homage to the secret compartment in the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars.\
* This can give you a profit of 1350 if you buy a full cargo hold of silicate 5 credits per ore and sell it at the [[Mega Base]].\
*This ship has two limited variants, the [[Patriotic Hercules]], released during the [https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fourth_of_July_2018 Fourth of July Event 2018] and the [[Retro Hercules]], released during the [[Retro Ship Event 2019]].[[File:Hercules.png|thumb|180x180px|Old Hercules model]]\

== Appearance ==\
'''<span style=\"color:yellow\">This section is currently outdated. Please update it when it is possible to do so.</span>'''\
\
\
\
The '''Atheon''' has a very simple interior; you enter through an oval cockpit containing the pilot seat.\
\
\
==Advantages==\
*Great maneuverability.\
* No blind spots.\
*Classed as a Cruiser while having Battleship/Dreadnought DPS\
*Slightly higher health, DPS, and turret count than the [[Zhen]], an advanced battlecruiser.\
* Very good spinal damage against shields.\
*Great for swarming large ships with many blind spots, like the [[Subjugator]].\
*Turrets have high range considering the ship's class.\
*Perfect for Alien hunting due to the [[Shields|shield]] breaking [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]] and [[hull]] breaking [[turrets]].\
*Amazing shield breaking power for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*Very expensive for its class.\
*Turrets often miss when fired against small, moving targets.\
*Difficult to fire all turrets at once unless facing the target head-on.\
* Small cargo hold, disabling the ability to loot large wrecks.\
*Can usually be destroyed by precision turrets with ease.\
*Weak to heavy AA fire from ships such as the [[Ampharos]] and [[Tempest]]\
==Strategy==\
* Quickly overwhelm the enemy when used in swarms, and target the blind spots of [[Ships|larger or more inaccurate ships.]]\
*Because of the rarity of this ship it can be used to lure people out of their base during war.\
*Be cautious around ships with precision turrets, they can easily kill you.\
* Use this in swarms to completely annihilate shield tanks.\
*Use the lack of popularity to your advantage, and easily destroy ships like [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] piloted by newer players.\
== Version History==\
*Added in version .66b\
*Advanced turrets replaced with equivalent custom turrets in version .66b.\

==Description==\
The '''Panther''' is a uniquely-shaped [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] with high top speed, maneuverability, and [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower. It is comparable to the [[Sentaliz]], but with more [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower and more health. The shape of the '''Panther''' roughly resembles its namesake.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Panther''' is very similar to that of the [[Armageddon]], with a small detailed room containing the teleporter and pilot's seat.\
==Advantages==\
* Ludicrous [[Spinals]] dps.\
* Decent [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
\
* Very high mobility.\
* A great support ship if you put it with a large fleet, as it can be a huge source of damage.\
* Fast for its class, faster than most Battlecruisers.\
* Great acceleration for its class.\
*Extremely high overall DPS, higher than some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] at a whopping '''261 DPS''' (Spinal) '''150 DPS''' (Turret)'''.'''\
==Disadvantages==\
* Very expensive and requires VIP.\
* Very low health for it's class.\
* Vulnerable bottom.\
* Due to its fairly large size it can easily be hit by spinals.\
* Can be hard to aim spinals due to the odd front section.\
* Interior as of .76b24 can bug the camera resulting in the loss of this ship if it's low on health and is dived by players or NPCs\
==Strategy==\
* Make sure to put your [[Spinals]] to use as they are quite powerful in battle.\
* Due to its high speed and relatively high general durability, diving a [[Starbase]] is a relatively easy task, however, it's not completely immune to damage.\
* It can be used to protect bigger ships from [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]], using its [[Turrets]], or from bigger ships, using it's [[Spinals]].\
* You are going to have to rely on range if you are traveling alone.\
* Situational awareness is highly relied on when using the '''Panther'''. A tiny ship sneaking up on you could be your end.\
* If you know that there is no escape nuke yourself and you have the slight chance of taking something with you\
*The '''Panther''' has a play style similar to the [[Helios]], as both are glass cannons, extremely maneuverable, and can do huge amounts of damage.\
==Version History==\
* .61h1 - Speed reduced, HP slightly increased.\
\
* .61h1 - Huge nerf in HP, [[Spinals|Spinal]] count halved, speed reduced, acceleration reduced, [[Spinals|Spinal]] size decreased to \"large\".\
\
* .61h1 - HP buff, [[Spinals]] are now both 3-barrel large, speed increased, some [[Turrets]] removed.\
\
* .61h1 - 1 [[Turrets|Small Turret]], 10 more speed, -250 shield, 1 more [[Spinals|Large Phaser]].\
* Was removed from [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] and made public in version ???\
* Received a stat change in .63h that added 500 shield and hull, buffed the [[Turrets|Medium Laser]] to a [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]], removed 30 speed, and slightly changed the price.\
* Buffed in .66b, losing its small turret and gaining a medium and 2 larges.\
* Remodeled in version .67c.\
*Explosion size increased in version .69e.\
*Was added back to VIP in version .73a3.\
*Explosion Size 100 ----> 320 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
* Received over four major changes in the span of a few hours.\
* The current '''Panther''' model was a near-replica of the Minmatar Panther-class Black Ops Battleship from EVE Online. See link: https://evepics.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/eppantheralign.jpg\
* This ship used to be a [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] ship.\
* The Panther is basically a bigger [[Tengu]].\
* Highest DPS of all battleships as of .69a.\

== Description ==\
The '''Aegis''' is a large shield-melting [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]. It has 2 prominent blast wings at the sides, similar to some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Aegis''' has a small teleporter on one front wing that leads to the interior. The interior has a pilot's seat and a small glowing control board. Behind the seat is a doorway and keypad that leads to a separate room with some crates and two counters, on which rests a Razer-brand toaster.\
== Advantages ==\
* High firepower from both [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]].\
* High [[shields]].\
* Good mobility for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* High Acceleration for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* Good Turret Placement.\
* Amazing against ships like the [[Hawklight]] or [[Ampharos]]. \
* Icon is smaller than a normal Battleship, this is because the '''Aegis '''is smaller. This can be helpful when hiding under dreads then warping.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Very weak [[Hull]].\
* Expensive.\
* Easy to kill with [[Shields|Shield]] damaging [[Ships]] like the [[Zeus]].\
* Not as effective against smaller ships as other battleships. Either the [[Loyalist]] or [[Ampharos]] would be better options against faster ships.\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship can be used as a support ship in sieges with its versatile amount of [[Turrets]], and can tank fire from hull shredding anti-siege ships for some time. It also performs somewhat decently in PvP.\
* Instead of retreating when reaching [[hull]], you should to retreat at around 25-40% [[Shields]], since most ships will dive you due to the weak hull.\
* Retreat when there is a risk of being overpowered. You can back off quickly due to its high acceleration.\
* [[Starbase]]s will make short work of the '''Aegis's''' shields, so watch out during sieges.\
* Due to the '''Aegis's''' large amount of [[Shields]] and low amount of [[Hull]], avoid [[ships]] with a lot of [[Turrets|Laser Turrets]] like the [[Zeus]].\
* A very powerful way to employ Aegis is in 1 on 1 battleship or lower, warping tactically right behind a ship or at least very close to get a full turret salvo off on an enemy ship, and utilize the [[spinals]] after your large lasers have shredded their [[shields]]. Doing this on a Battlecruiser usually results in the Battlecruiser getting very low or destroyed before being able to warp out.\
*\
== Version History ==\
* Received some changes in .63h that added 900 [[Shields|Shield]], added 1 [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]], lowered the Speed from 100 to 80, and increased the price.\
* Max Shield increased to 5300 from 5000 in .65b\
* Remodeled in version .66b\
* Turn speed reduced from 0.45 to 0.4 in version .66b\
* Buffed in .66b, making its two light lasers become two medium lasers.\
*Explosion Size 45 ----> 270 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Aegis''' had a limited event remodel, the [[Glacier]], on sale for the [[Christmas Event 2017]]. The limited event ship itself is stronger than the '''Aegis''' in health, but no longer looks similar to the '''Aegis''' due to its new remodel.\
* The old '''Aegis '''looks similar to the [https://sinsofasolarempire.fandom.com/wiki/Ankylon_Titan Ankylon] Titan from [https://sinsofasolarempire.fandom.com/wiki/Rebellion Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion].\

== Description ==\
The '''Disruptor '''is an Alien redesign of the [[Razor Wing]].\
\
It comes equipped with 4 [[Kneall]] cannon-based weapons, instead of the usual loadout for the [[Razor Wing]]. \
\
The Disruptor contains an impressive loadout of [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]], making it good for [[Pirating]] and engaging [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], as well as engaging Small Ships with it's flak turrets.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Disruptor''' is an asymmetrical and small [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]]. Unlike the [[Razor Wing]]. this variant has [[Aliens|Kneall]]-themed colors.\
\
The '''Interior''' is similar to the [[Razor Wing]]'s interior. There is a pilot seat in the very front, and a long hallway with four corridors branching off of it. \
\
It can sometimes be confusing to try and get out of the Disruptor''', '''as all the doors look the same.\
== Advantages ==\
* Great and [[Galaxy Slang|Balanced]] [[Galaxy Slang|DPS]] for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]], at 239.\
*The [[Turrets]] on top provide good defense while the [[Spinals|Spinal]] loadout contains an even higher damage output.\
* Moves quick for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] and a top speed of 120.\
* Higher health than its [[Razor Wing]] counterpart.\
*Unlike other [[:Category:Alien|Kneall]] Ships, most of the Disruptor's turrets are accurate.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Has no form of defense underneath, making it high priority to keep the fight away from your underside.\
* Relies on spinals for much of its damage output, thus requiring good aim.\
*High [[Spinals|Spinal]] count and long interval may make it difficult to engage small ships when using its [[Spinals]].\
*Low health for a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ship.\
*Extremely expensive material cost for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]]-class Ship, requiring 5000 Uranium.\
== Strategy ==\
* With an excellent armament towards PvP, it's best intended for either finishing off a crippled ship in a swarm, or attacking an unsuspecting vessel.\
* Be extremely careful with this, as people will focus on you and go for the rare kill due to it having a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] status and its expense.\
*The low health makes this an easy target for skilled players if not careful.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .66b after the hunt for the [[Prototype X-3]] (September 16th)\
* Spinals reduced from 7/7 to 6/6, minimap icon color changed to always be [[Aliens|Alien]]-green in version .68e.\
* Spinals increased to 8/8 and re-released temporarily in version .69a2 (August 4th, 2020 through September 2nd, 2020).\
*Icon color changed to normal in an unknown version.\
*Made available again during the [[Kneall Event]] in version .75a10\
== Trivia ==\
* Confirmed to be a pre-nerfed, original [[Razor Wing]] through its stats, with the exception of one missing [[Turrets|Turret]].\
* Mopy_B was the first to lose this ship to rayquazam8.\
* One of the only limited ships to be released thrice.\
*Used to be one of the only ships to require alien parts to make.\
*It is the only limited ship to be a [[Kneall]] redesign.\
*Re-released along with the [[Bionicle]] in Part 3 of the [[Kneall Event]].\

The '''Sovereign''' features an array of different [[Turrets]] and balanced stats for taking on a variety of ships. Its low maneuverability means it can be exploited by certain blind spots, making it heavily recommended that players be cautious while using this.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior is a small but detailed box containing the pilot seat and a couple of screens.\
== Advantages ==\
* Cheap cost compared to other battleships.\
* Versatile mix of [[Turrets]].\
* Great healthpool, one of the highest for battleships.\
* Has many [[Turrets|Kinetic Turrets]], making it a powerful hull breaker.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Tied with the [[Archeon]] and [[Genesis]] as the second slowest battleship in the game (top speed).\
* Vulnerable bottom.\
* Very poor damage output for a battleship, and considering that the [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannon]] cannot fire because of LoS it is worse than practically every other [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] in the game.\
* Must be facing towards the target to use all turrets, and even then the ventral [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannon]] cannot fire due to line of sight issues.\
* Despite having a [[Spinals|Larger Spinal]] than the [[Hawklight]], the [[Hawklight|Hawklight's]] [[Spinals]] do more damage.\
* Lacks shield breaking weapons.\
* The combination of a less than ideal turret and spinal armament(very poor damage output), below average maneuverability, and inflexible turret line of sight makes for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] that is not only overall awful, but also very weak and easily destroyed by a single skilled [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] pilot or another [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
== Strategy ==\
* Be careful if an agile ship attacks you, as it may be able to outmaneuver your ship.\
* If possible, stick to fleets. More often than not your additional firepower will help to destroy enemy fleets and bases.\
* Avoid ships that are both versatile and deal heavy damage, such as the [[Leviathan]] or [[Razor Wing]].\
== Version History ==\
* Buffed in version .63a?\
* Remodeled in an unknown version.\
*Remodeled again in version .66b, and was also buffed, with its shield increasing from 3500 to 4050, it hull from 3000 to 3350, its large cannon spinal becoming 2 large cannons, its 3 light turrets and Medium Laser were removed, being replaced by a Dual Medium Cannon and a Triple Heavy Cannon. Its cargo hold also increased from 250 to 253 as well as its acceleration increasing from 19 to 23.\
*[[Shields]] reduced to 3700 in version .69a1.\
*Explosion size 60 ----> 275 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* Excellent first battleship—its durability allows even inexperienced players escape bad situations.\
* The remodeled version was originally meant to be an [[Hawklight]] remodel.\
* Used to be seen as weak by a lot of players.\
* It has the exact same description as the Hawklight\

== Description ==\
The '''Bastion''' is a heavy [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] that focuses on [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower. Its main body features two large protruding thrusters and an elevated cockpit area with a rounded window. This ship's relatively high turret count makes it effective against both smaller ships and larger ships.\
== Appearance ==\
Once entering the '''Bastion''', you will enter a small room with no interior but a single seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Variety of [[Turrets]].\
* No blind spots.\
* Very high health.\
* Great for beginners, as it has ease of use with the turret based armament and is a good ship as an introduction to [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]].\
* Good damage output with the turrets.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Below average speed.\
* Though not a blind spot, the bottom is poorly defended.\
* Compared to the [[Mjolnheimr]] and [[Hyron]], the turrets are far less accurate. However, the '''Bastion''' does have higher damage output than both of the mentioned ships.\
* Due to the way the ship is shaped you have to turn it to get it out of dock which can give time to enemy [[Ships]] to do damage.\
== Strategy ==\
* Performs well as a support ship in sieges as it has many small [[Turrets]] to destroy incoming small [[Ships]].\
* Best used for attacking [[Ships]] below its size, as it has trouble with [[Ships]] of same class due to its inferior mobility causing it to be unable to escape easily.\
* Against [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]], exploiting blind spots is your best bet against them.\
== Version History ==\
* In an older version <span>it used to have a massive explosion upon death, which heavily damaged nearby [[Ships]] and destroyed base </span>[[Turrets]]<span>. This has since been fixed.</span>\
* Buffed in .64d to gain another [[Turrets|Medium Laser]] and 100 more health in each stat.\
* Medium Lasers replaced with Point Defense Laser and Long Range Laser in version .66b\
*1 Long Range Laser replaced with 1 [[Turrets|Point Defense Laser]] in version .69e due to the Long Range Laser's removal from the game.\
*2 [[Turrets|Point Defense Lasers]] changed to 2 Dual Medium Lasers and 1 Medium Railgun changed to 1 Heavy Railgun in version .73c10.\
*2 Light Lasers and 1 Heavy Railgun replaced with 1 Heavy Siege Railgun, and 2 Dual Medium Cannons in version .75a5.\
*Dual Medium Cannons and Dual Medium Lasers replaced with Triple Medium versions, the Heavy Siege Railgun replaced with a SR PDL, Shield/Hull health increased from 1,950/2,000 to 2,100/2,200 respectively, Top Speed increased from 90 to 95, Turn Speed increased from 0.48 to 0.5, and Acceleration increased from 23 to 34 in version .75a5.\
== Trivia ==\
* Named after a defensive architectural design built into medieval European castles. A '''Bastion''' protruded from a castle's walls, allowing defenders to attack from all angles.\
* The '''Bastion''' was one of the most used ships in [[Galaxy Arcade]] before it received a gamepass in version .69d1\
* The original '''Bastion''' model had an easter egg that includes a Gnome on a desk with a few pieces of blank paper.[[File:Gnome.png|thumb|220x220px]]\
* For a period of time the '''Bastion''' could not move or dock. The whole situation started with the gnome's hat falling off and preventing the ship from moving.\
*The right console on the original model had some memes like the illuminati triangle on it.\

}}\
==Description==\
The '''Mantid''' was an Avellian Dreadnought that was obtained via a quest from a gift box in a Christmas-themed cabin that could be reached through a teleporter in the [[Mega Base]]. It is similar to the [[Khapri]] and [[Shadowmane]] in design and some traits of its armament. It's weaponry is overall balanced, sporting an array of powerful point defence laser weaponry on the bottom, and cannon weaponry on the top, as well as 4 Huge Cannons for spinals.\
==Interior==\
The Interior is simplistic; there is one long hallway with a pilot's seat and hexagonal texturing. Next to the pilot's seat there is a \"Holy Glock Sniper\", presumably for use in emergencies.\
==Advantages==\
*High balanced damage output makes it useful for fighting other [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]].\
*Above average speed and acceleration for a Dreadnought.\
*Very small profile when facing head-on or backwards, on top of the smallest size for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]](is less large than the [[Kraken]], a dreadnought known partially for its rather small size); causing inaccurate and decently accurate turrets alike to often miss your ship.\
*Has a combined health pool of 12,000 health.\
*Avellian Spears are very similar to the [[Prototype X-1|Prototype X-1's]] [[Turrets|Bombardment Cannons]], except that they are PDLs; which allows this ship to hold its own against small swarms fairly well.\
*High fire-rate, especially from the Avellian Spears, which have a reload speed of just one second.\
*Good line-of-sight, and has almost no blindspots; and most turrets being able to fire from all forward-facing angles.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Somewhat sluggish turning compared to the speed, making it awkward for some to pilot.\
*Flatness makes you very easy to hit when being targeted from above or below.\
*No hull-based weaponry on the underbelly of the ship.\
*Spinals have a high interval, and are sometimes difficult to aim due to the ship's slow turning.\
*[[:Category:Limited|Limited]] classification means you will be targeted often.\
==Strategy==\
*Only use this ship if you are sure you will not lose it.\
*Don't attempt to fight PvP ships that can outperform you, such as the [[Cyber Leviathan]], [[Frankenemi]], or [[Azreal]] for example.\
*Use this to chase down hulled ships, it is effective at damaging hull.\
*Target ships that are large or sluggish, and if possible abuse their blindspots for the most effectiveness in PvP.\
*Stay where you are comfortable in fights: don't take risks, as being hulled can quickly spell doom for this ship.\
==Version History==\
*Mantid's cargo hold was at 0 but then changed to 200 in .75a1.\
*8 Tiny Phasers and 8 Tiny Cannons changed to 2 Large Cannons, then currently 4 Huge Cannons in version .75a1.\
*Explosion Size 250 ----> 800 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*This ship's model is actually a modified version of one of the former rejected remodels in a modeling contest for the [[Lazarus]], also created by ap_ek.\
*The first person to lose a '''Mantid''' was xlCamm to an [[Avellian Stronghold]].\
*Was once unable to spawn for 3 hours due to an issue causing the turrets to not load in at all.\
*It has been rumored that rocket turrets were planned to be introduced and used for this ship, as well as other Avellian ships, however were never added due to needing rcouret for them to be properly implemented.\
*The description for this ship is in reference to how the Christmas 2021 event ended early, meaning the lore for the event was not fully completed. \"auri\" is referencing Preauri, one of the game's Loremasters. yname([[User:Wingy]]) is a Developer.\

}}\
==Description==\
The Kneall Bionicle is the NPC counterpart of the [[Brawler]] and shares the exact same model and stats as the mentioned ship. \
\
Like all other [[Aliens|Alien]] ships, it has a fixed damage resistance of 30%.\
==Behavior==\
The Kneall Bionicle exhibits typical AI behavior: Slowly approaches your ship while attacking if in range. \
\
Once its at its closest point from your ship, It will start to go in the opposite direction until ~4k to 6k~ where it turns around again, restarting the cycle.\
\
It has the ability to call aid from other [[Aliens]] in the map and will attack [[:Category:Planets|Planets]]/[[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]] if in range.\
\
It has an attention range of 13k studs much like most other AI Ships, anything below that count of studs means it will start slowly moving at you until it's in range with its weapons and it will immediately call aid from [[aliens]] present on the map. There is also a chance it will warp and chase you if you warp beyond its attention range of 13k studs.\
\
Currently it spawns every 18 minutes at the same time as the [[Punisher]] near the [[Devastator]] during the [[Kneall Event]].\
==Strategy==\
*Much like the [[Decimator]], the Kneall Bionicle's AI is also it's weakness where it goes in your opposite direction, losing over half of its firepower. You can exploit this weakness by being close to the ship so it's forced to turn around in the opposite direction.\
*The Kneall Bionicle has powerful Spinals and extremely accurate [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] aim which it's accuracy can gun down even ships as small as [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyers]] if you're not careful. You can circumvent this by going side to side and not towards or away from it when using a fast, agile Ship, or exploit it's blindspot in the back from its AI when using a large, slow, Capital ship.\
*Warp out as soon as it's destroyed as it has a massive explosion size of <u>5k Studs</u> for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Currently, it spawns only at the [[Devastator]], you can lure it away from its Starbase in order to not risk losing your ship from the Devastator's firepower.\
*It also spawns with the [[Punisher]] at the same time, this can be threatening even for [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] as the combined firepower of both can be as much as a [[Decimator]]. To take both down, get either [[Punisher]] or the Bionicle's attention and once they start firing, warp back to your Starbase to aid you in taking both down. You can also do this without a starbase, but it requires experience and skill and/or powerful ships such as a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] or a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]].\
==Loot==\
The wreck of the Kneall Bionicle contains 5 Bionicle Parts, 3 Plasma Batteries and 100 Alien Parts and gives 7k-9k [[Money Making|Combat reward]].\
==Version History==\
*Added and implemented in version .75a10 in the [[Kneall Event]].\
\
*Stopped spawning during the conclusion of the Kneall Event.\
==Trivia==\
*One of the only ships to have 3 Different variants with the same model, the 2 other variants are the Player-owned [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] [[Brawler]] and the Fighter [[A - Brawler]].\
*The Bionicle parts it drops is used in [[Reverse Engineering]], and has a quest in the Terminal C where you can exchange 100 of it for 110k credits inside the [[Mega Base]]\
*It's icon is extremely large, far larger than the [[Punisher]] and the [[Decimator]]\
*The only NPC Counterpart that has the exact same stats, turrets and spinals as it's player based counterpart.\

== Description ==\
One of the first player-submitted ships to be added, though the original model has since been replaced. A [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] which strikes a balance between its [[Turrets]], [[Spinals|Spinal Weapons]], durability, and maneuverability, but excels the most at pirating ships as large or larger than itself.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Aeaphiel''' is quite plain. The ship doesn't even have a door, it's just has a gaping hole into the vacuum of space. Once entering the ship you will be greeted by a very empty room with a lot of unused space. The pilot's seat is at the front of the ship facing some screens that control the ship.\
== Advantages ==\
* Decent all-rounder.\
* High [[shields]], higher than any other non-limited [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]], with the exception of the [[MRLS Launcher]].\
* Good [[Shields|Shield]] health.\
* Very convenient [[Turrets|Turret]] placement.\
* Heavy Railgun has a whopping 8000 range, which outranges a level 1 [[Starbase]].\
* 2nd fastest ship of its class, as well as being very maneuverable.\
* Amazing overall damage output for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]], being higher than any other ship in its class with the exception of some [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ships in the same class.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Must be facing head-on to do max damage.\
*Spaced out spinals (2 phasers on one side and 2 on the other) make it difficult to hit smaller targets with full damage.\
* Requires [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass]] to obtain.\
* Somewhat large size for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]], making this easy to hit with [[Turrets|Flak and Point Defence Turrets]] even while moving at your top speed.\
* The most expensive build menu [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]], being more expensive than a few [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
* Mediocre [[Hull]] compared to [[Shields]].\
== Strategy ==\
* Use this against weakened [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], as your high speed and high damage can easily snag a kill.\
* Attack head-on like you would in a [[Sixfold]] or [[Lusso]], so all [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals|Phasers and Cannons]] can hit the target.\
* Avoid AA ships at the class of [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], their accurate firepower is enough to easily destroy this ship.\
* If possible, use this ship in swarms against large ships as you can easily overwhelm and destroy an overconfident large target.\
== Version History ==\
* Light Laser changed to Light Cannon in .64d, shield increased by 150\
* Max Shield increased to 2350 from 2150 in .65b\
*Hull buffed from 600 to 1670, speed buffed from 145 to 200, 1 Dual Medium Cannon replaced with a Heavy Railgun, gained 4 Small Cannon spinals, now requires VIP in version .73b3.\
*1 Light Cannon replaced with 1 Dual Medium Cannon, 1 Dual Medium Laser added in version .73b3 (this was only revealed in-game).\
== Trivia ==\
* In .51a The Aeaphiel received a remodel from ARiNA_AZUMA. It originally had 2000 shields, 800 hull, 2 [[Turrets|Light Lasers]], 1 [[Turrets|Railgun]], 1 [[Turrets|Medium Laser]], and 2 [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]].\
* Has a similar design to the [[Sentaliz]], also made by ARiNA_AZUMA.\
* Prior to the remake, sometimes it would be difficult to enter the driver's seat.\
* It resembles an old [[Starblade]] model.\

== Description ==\
The '''Cyber Leviathan''' is a limited edition reskin for the [[Leviathan]], with a cyber, more futuristic appearance. It comes equipped with 9 [[Turrets|Quantum Turrets]].\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Cyber Leviathan's''' interior is similar to the Leviathan's interior. The only change is that the teleporter that goes in and out is red instead of blue.\
== Advantages ==\
* Great Turret Placement.\
* Second-fastest [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] in the game behind the [[Slipstream]], with 130 top speed.\
* 9 [[Turrets|Quantum Turrets]] give it amazing siege capabilites.\
* High health.\
* Good turn rate for its size.\
* Insanely destructive hull damage output, only behind the [[Prototype X-2]], [[Hyperion]], [[Theia]], and [[Prototype X-1]]; making this ship one of the best crippled ship killers in the game.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Precise aiming of the spinals is HIGHLY recommended.\
* Most weaknesses are in common with the standard [[Leviathan]].\
* Incredibly expensive.\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship's most ideal use is to chase down crippled ships, much like the [[Leviathan]].\
* Like its non-limited counterpart, the '''Cyber Leviathan''' is also great at PvP.\
* Decent for fleet sieges since most new players fear or have no idea what this ship is, causing even more fear.\
* Utilize it in a fleet.\
* Be extremely careful with this, as people are going to focus fire on a '''Cyber Leviathan'''.\
== Version History ==\
* Speed was increased by 1 in version .75a3.\
*Added in .65a as part of [[Halloween Event 2018]].\
* Received a buff in .65a4? that increased Max Speed from 50 to 100.\
* Buffed in version .66b - Dual Medium Cannons replaced with Quad Advanced Medium Cannons, Medium Lasers replaced with Dual Medium Lasers, turn rate increased from 0.18 to 0.2, Top Speed increased from 100 to 110, Shield increased from 6000 to 6650, Hull increased from 5000 to 5800.\
* Buffed in version .66g to 6300 hull and 7150 shield\
* Buffed and remodeled in version .68e; Speed 110 > 120, Accel 9 > 15, Cannon turrets changed to Quantum counterparts.\
* Hull reduced to 5800 in version .68e.\
*Spinals swapped from 2 Huge Cannons to 4 Tiny Torpedoes, Cargo Hold increased from 1190 to 1500 in version .73b8\
*Maneuverability and Health buffed: Top speed increased from 120 to 139, Acceleration increased from 15 to 50, turn speed increased from 0.2 to 0.26, and shield/hull HP adjusted form 7150/5800 to 7000/6175 in version .73c(?).\
*Spinals buffed to 2 Medium Torpedoes on the [F] spinal and 2 Tiny Torpedoes on the [G] spinal in version .73c(?).\
*Turret loadout changed to 4 Quantum Cannons, 2 Heavy Quantum Cannons, 2 Heavy Quantum Lasers and 1 Triple Heavy Quantum Laser in an unknown version.\
*Explosion Size 320 ----> 800 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* jay4444444444 was the first player to lose a '''Cyber Leviathan''' to another player but was refunded later on.\
* One of the most detailed ships in the game.\
* If one were to zoom out while piloting this ship, you can notice an [[Osiris Legion]] flag on the frontwards most part of the inner-outer interior.\
* Between the '''Cyber Leviathan''' and its normal counterpart, the Leviathan, the '''Cyber Leviathan''' has 1250 more Shields, 825 more Hull, 64 more Top Speed, 25 More Acceleration, 0.06 more turn speed, more powerful turrets, more powerful Spinals and 1435 more cargo hold.[[File:CyberLeviInterior.png|thumb|293px|The original '''Cyber Leviathan's''' astonishing interior.]]\

"Remains_of_U.N.E_Starbase_12","{{Outdated (Image)}}\
\
The '''''Remains of U.N.E Starbase 12''''' are a set of lore-based remains hidden in the map.\
{{Planetary_Infobox_V1|Starbase or Planet Name = Remains of U.N.E Starbase 12|planet atmosphere (exterior) = |shield = 0|hull = Critical|Level 2 Name = Terminals|image2 = |additional level 2 title = Terminal Interiors|Additional lvl2 picture = |additional level 2 title1 = Interior|Additional lvl2 picture2 = |Level 3 Name = Destroyed Ships|image3 = }}\
==Description==\
The '''Remains of U.N.E Starbase 12''' lie somewhere off center from the map, somewhat towards the top left. The structure has three destroyed ships associated with the U.N.E around it: a [[Chimera]], an [[Orion]], and a [[Aliens|Kneall Outrider]]. The starbase largely resembles an old Level 1 Starbase, but it has a large crack across the roof, and terminals C and D are partly or completely destroyed. The Starbase does not appear as a select-able structure and has no menu or health GUI when entered. Ships also cannot dock, even at the relatively intact terminals.\
\
==Interior==\
The only interactive part of the starbase is a small, non-quest dialogue hosted by the Starbase computer (adjacent to terminal C). The rest of the interior is covered in fires and rusted parts, as well as bodies of U.N.E soldiers in various levels of mutilation. One corner screen has a large condition red alert, and the other has a damaged U.N.E enlistment propaganda poster (the same one seen in the [[Mega Base]] with a [[Punisher]] on it).\

== Description ==\
The '''Icarus''' is a large-sized carrier with very good combat capabilities. With its [[Turrets]] and 3 [[Valkyrie]]s, the '''Icarus''' is a powerful combat-based [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]]. Unlike most Carriers, it has very good Turret firepower and can fight against a variety of ships, ranging from small [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]] to large [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]]. It may even destroy [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] without much trouble, though this requires [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] support and skill.\
== Appearance ==\
The ship is entered through the [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] bay, which leads to a teleporter that sends you to the bridge. From there you walk forward to enter the pilot's seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Powerful on its own, without the need of any [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* Good Health.\
* Has powerful [[Valkyrie|Fighters]], which have high [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] firepower.\
*Equipping all fighters with AI pilots is relatively cheap, costing only 750 robux to fill them all with VIP.\
*Useful for quickly taking down Capital ships with the high DPS of the ship and fighters combined.\
*Can easily destroy AI enemies by distracting them with fighters and using turrets for the rest.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low maneuverability.\
* Only has 3 Fighters.\
* Expensive.\
* Medium-sized blind spot at the rear of the ship.\
*Small ships can enter the fighter bay.\
*Large blindspot underneath the ship\
== Strategy ==\
* Don't go into battle alone as multiple strong ships can overwhelm it. Make sure to have an escort and pick fights carefully.\
* Know how to pilot this kind of ship and bring [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] pilots before entering combat.\
* Make sure to approach from below so your [[Turrets]] can be used.\
* With having [[Valkyrie]] fighters, it is beneficial to take advantage of them as they have great DPS and speed.\
== Version History ==\
* Most of the interior was removed in an unknown version.\
* Received a Turret loadout rework, a health buff, switch of Fighters, and a Cargo Hold buff in .65b.\
* The model became seriously bugged after the .66c update, resulting in major problems and making the ship near unusable.\
* Received a remodel in version .68b.\
* Health increased from 6500/5250 to 8500/8000 in version .68d.\
*Loadout changed from 1 Dual Medium Laser, 5 Dual Medium Cannons, 2 Triple Heavy Lasers, 1 Heavy Cannon to 3 Triple Medium lasers, 1 Triple Heavy Cannon, 2 Triple Heavy Lasers, 3 Triple medium cannons in version .73a3.\
*Turret loadout changed from 3 Triple Medium Lasers, 1 Triple Heavy Cannon, 2 Triple Heavy Lasers, and 3 Triple Medium Cannons to 1 Super LR Laser, 1 Heavy Siege Railgun, 1 Capital Triple Cannon, 2 Super PDLs, 2 Capital Triple Lasers, and 2 Super Flak Cannons, turret placement adjusted to improve line-of-sight, 2 Valkyries changed to 3 Valkyries, and Health pool adjusted to 9,000/7,250 Shield/Hull HP respectively in version .75a5.\
*2 Super PDLs replaced with 2 Medium Siege Railguns in version .75a5.\
== Trivia ==\
* The previous model was most likely based on the Republic Venator attack cruiser from Star Wars.\
* This ship is often considered a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]-[[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] hybrid because it has more firepower than most [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] do, but also carries some [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* This ship's namesake has significance in Greek mythology.\

}}\
==Description ==\
The '''Snowfall''' is a winter-themed [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] that has focus on [[Galaxy Terminology|Broadside]]-firepower.\
\
This [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] focuses on [[Galaxy Terminology|Broadside]]-firepower and excels at being a flagship in a fleet due to the diversity of [[Turrets]] it has and having a high health for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]. It's firepower leans more on shredding [[Shields]] due to it's 10 Medium Phasers.\
==Appearance==\
The Snowfall is a long [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] with most of it's materials being made of snow. There are spiky ice ornaments decorated all around the ships, including 5 Spinal Barrels on each side of the ship. \
\
The Interior is snow-covered box, containing a yellow-teleporter door and the pilot seat.\
==Advantages==\
*Diversity of [[Turrets]] gives it accuracy and the ability to hit small [[Ships]].\
*High turn-speed and acceleration for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship.]]\
*Has the ability to shred [[Shields]] at a [[Galaxy Terminology|Shield DPS]] of 379.\
*Great [[Spinals]] for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship.]]\
*Excels at broadside combat.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Expensive for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] and will be hunted for being a [[:Category:Limited|Limited Ship.]]\
* Broadside Spinals can be difficult to get used to.\
* Has low [[Galaxy Terminology|Hull DPS]] compared to Shield.\
* [[Galaxy Terminology|Unbalanced]] Shield Health compared to Hull, making it vulnerable against Hull-Breakers.\
*The total health does not reflect well on the total price, especially for a [[Ships|Battleship.]]\
==Strategy==\
*Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.\
*Always face the side of your ship to the enemy to maximize damage output, especially its Spinals.\
*Focus on shield tank ships such as the [[Aegis]], or [[Judgement]] as the ship outputs high [[Galaxy Terminology|Shield DPS]]. \
*When one [[Spinals|Spinal]] is reloading, fire the other [[Spinals|Spinal]] while turning your ship with your fast turnspeed.\
*Avoid Hull-Breakers such as the [[Ridgebreaker]], or [[Hawklight]] due to your unbalanced health.\
*Remember to use [[Spinals]], as they account for 60% of this ships' total DPS.\
==Version History==\
* 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Frost Triple Heavy Cannons]] in version .69a1.\
*Was released again in the \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a D class permit (credits vary from time to time) + 13386 Sillicate, 10326 Carbon, 8502 Iridium, 892 Adamantite, 1784 Palladium, 1078 Titanium, 1078 Quantium, and 273 Uranium.\
*Explosion size 60 ----> 540 in version .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*One of few ships with broadside [[Spinals]], which include the [[Behemoth]], [[Osiris]] and some others.\
*The first person to lose this ship was [[User:ELITEGAMEZ321|ELITEGAMEZ321]] to aliens.\
*Has a wide array of turrets making it good for many situations.\

The '''''Crystocrene''''' is a '''[[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]''' added during the [[Christmas Event 2020|2020 Christmas event]].\
\
== Description ==\
The '''Crystocrene''' is a winter-themed Battleship added in version .69f after the [[Antares Comet]] collided with [[Aqueous II]]. The quest to obtain it could have been found on the planet by finding a red sphere in the snowman cave.\
\
It is a very capable siege ship thanks to its custom railguns and torpedoes. However, if the pilot is experienced with aiming the latter, it also proves to be devastating in capital ship combat. These traits, among others, practically make it a mini [[Hyperion]].\
== Appearance ==\
The ship's exterior has a sci-fi twist to a winter theme. It has many icicles located troughout the ship and features a baby blue and grey color scheme. There are multiple neon pattern carvings colored in the former color. The ship has a moderate size. \
== Advantages ==\
* Armed with 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Quantum Lasers]], which is a rather unusual, but powerful laser armament on a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* Very high [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] firepower.\
* Very good in sieges due to having 4 [[Turrets|Icy Artillery Cannons]], and [[Spinal Weaponry|3 Large Torpedoes]].\
* Large amount of hull health allows it to tank shield-oriented weaponry very well.\
* Incredibly high alpha damage for a Battleship; it has almost as much alpha damage as the infamous [[Judgement]].\
* Great acceleration and turn speed.\
* Extremely high damage output for a ship of its class, being higher than even the [[Helios]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* As a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ship, it is a large target and will be focused.\
* Disappointedly low hull damage for the kinetic weaponry it has.\
* Large Torpedoes are slow, and thus hard to hit against moving targets.\
* Weak shields; can be easily destroyed by hull breakers such as the [[Ridgebreaker]].\
* Its large turrets have horrid accuracy.\
== Strategy ==\
* Stay away from hull breakers, as the Crystocrene is not able to endure them for long due to its low shields.\
* In sieges, stay at a safe distance and use your torpedoes. However, if an ally is tanking the base, you can go closer and use your turrets.\
== Version History ==\
*It used to have a total of 2 Heavy Icy Artillery Cannons, 4 Medium Icy Artillery Cannons and 2 Frosty Triple Heavy Lasers when this ship was released in version .69[!] ~ .71[?]\
*Large Phaser count increased to 4, gained 4 Medium Cannons, Medium Advanced Autolaser and Advanced Autocannon changed to 2 Medium Crystal Railguns in version .72c20.\
*2 Medium Crystal Railguns changed to 2 Medium Artillery Cannons and [[hull]] buffed from 1500 to 2250 in version .72c20.\
*2 Frosty Triple Heavy Lasers replaced with 2 Triple Heavy Quantum Lasers, 4 Medium Cannon spinals replaced with 3 Large Torpedoes, Hull health buffed from 2,250 to 3,250, Top speed buff from 55 to 65, and acceleration buffed from 12 to 20 in version .75a1.\
*Explosion size 300 ----> 560 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The first person to lose this was [https://www.roblox.com/users/462328151/profile '''BADZAMAN'''] to [https://www.roblox.com/users/1006192836/profile GalaxyGrinder2319]'s [[Apocalypse]].\
* Can be found on [[Aqueous II]] by finding a red sphere in the snowman cave.\
* The quest for the ship only takes 60 snow flakes instead of 75 which the quest tells you.\
* You can solo any starbase as the Large Torpedoes will outrange all of their turrets.\
* The ship has custom sounds for its phaser spinals.\

== Description ==\
The '''Festive Wasp''' is a [[:Category:Limited|Limited Event]] ship, a reskin of the [[Wasp]].\
\
The exterior is orange and the boosters in the back are grey. It is also decorated with festive lights.\
\
You were only able to get this ship by asking a [[Galaxy Staff|Galaxy Admin]] for it on Christmas in the [[Christmas Event 2017]].\
\
Instead of carrying a Small Mining Laser like the normal [[Wasp]], it carries a [[Turrets|Large Mining Laser]].\
== Appearance ==\
Like the Wasp, the '''Festive Wasp''' has no interior.\
== Advantages ==\
* Great mobility.\
* Small, making it hard for [[Pirating|Pirates]] to aim at it.\
* Great Ore Hold for a small [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
* Great Cargo Hold for a small [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
* High health for a ship its size.\
* Nearly impossible to kill, due to the combination of high Speed and high health.\
* Good [[Mining]] speed.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* You can only get it once due to the fact that an admin would only give it to you once on a specific day.\
* Gives high [[Bounty]], which means [[Pirating|Pirates]]/[[Bounty]] Hunters will target you quite often if you use it.\
* [[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
*Your '''Festive Wasp''' can fling you randomly in a certain direction if you're moving around while mining because of the massive mining turret.\
== Strategy ==\
* <s>Show this ship off while mining. Your friends will wish they had a '''Festive Wasp'''.</s>\
* Treat this ship like a trophy, don't sell it or use it, ONLY use it if you are sure there is no [[Aliens]] around you and there are no factions which had declared war on you.\
* If you decided to use this ship, if a faction had declared war on you or an alien attacks you, quickly Dock at the nearest [[starbase]] and despawn your [[ships|ship]], ASAP.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in update .60a\
* Received a buff in update .60d that buffed Top Speed from 175 to 300.\
* Received a second buff in update .60d that fixed model issues and made the ship invisible on the [[Minimap]].\
* Received another buff in update .60d that upgraded the ship's [[Turrets|Small Mining Laser]] to a [[Turrets|Medium Mining Laser]].\
* Received 2 buffs in update .62a? that replaced the ship's [[Turrets|Medium Mining Laser]] with a [[Turrets|Large Mining Laser]] and increased Ore Hold by 250.\
== Trivia ==\
* Galaxy Admins would give you this along with the [[Coal Wasp|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Coal Wasp</span>]] on Christmas Day during the <span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Christmas Event of 2021</span>.\
*Only Galaxy Admins would give you this, and they'll only give it to you once.\
* Galaxy Admins would give you this along with the [[Coal Wasp|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Coal Wasp</span>]] on Christmas Day during the [[Christmas Event 2017|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Christmas Event 2017</span>]].\
* If you were able to sell this ship (and get it back, which would be a Christmas miracle), you would get about 77,566 [[Credits]], which would be enough for a lot of ships. (Don't attempt this, as it will result in failure)\
* This ship is a good backup [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] because of its [[Turrets|Large Mining Laser]].\
* One of the limited event ships available for one day, including the [[Coal Wasp|<span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">Coal Wasp</span>]], [[2018 Ship]] [surprise Raffle Ship on Discord], and the [[United States of Razor]].\
* The [[Turrets|Large Mining Laser]] is very disproportionate to the ship itself, as the laser is larger than the whole ship.\
* The total health of this ship is the same as the [[M Class]].\

The '''''Jackal '''''is a powerful [[Spinals|Spinal]]-focused [[:Category:Battleship|'''Battleship.''']]\
\
== Description ==\
The '''Jackal''' is a [[Spinals|Spinal]]-heavy ship that focuses on [[Hull]] damage. Its six Large Cannons tear apart any ship that is hulled; however, its [[Shields|Shield]] damage is also quite respectable. Unlike the [[Sentaliz]], the '''Jackal''' is very large, which is partly due to the remarkable amount of damage it produces.\
\
The exterior of the ship is very ornate. On the sides, you will find an array of beautiful and complex ridges and lines that give a sci-fi aesthetic to the ship. On the bottom is a large orb of neon orange/blue energy, likely the 'Hyperion Core' mentioned on the ship's console.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Jackal's '''interior is a small but incredibly detailed hallway leading up to the pilot's seat. The pilot seat itself glows orange, and is flanked on each side by two statues. In front of the pilot seat is a screen which reads \"Jackal Artillery Systems, Operation: Devistation, Hyperion Core: Operational\"\
== Advantages ==\
* Very high overall damage.\
* Insane damage to the Hull, double that of the Sentaliz and the [[Razor Wing]].\
* High damage to Shields, higher than that of the Sentaliz and the Razor Wing.\
* Well-placed Spinals.\
* Extremely large explosion radius often used to nuke enemy bases.\
* Tied with the [[Sentaliz]] and [[Santaliz]] as the 3rd fastest [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]], behind this ship's [[:Category:Halloween 2020|Halloween 2020 counterpart]] and [[Helios]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No ability to deal with smaller [[Ships]].\
* No Turrets.\
* Low HP for a Battleship.\
* Due to it being bulky, it is easy to be hit.\
== Strategy ==\
* Group up with other '''Jackals''' to make a fleet of near-unstoppable power.\
* Stay away from smaller Ships like the [[Cobra]] or [[Gideon]], as these can swarm and kill you.\
* Stay with Ships like the [[Ampharos]] or the [[Mjolnheimr]] to negate your lack of precise weapons.\
* Don't go alone, as you have no defense against small [[Ships]].\
* Keep distance from your enemies, you want minimal turret damage hitting you.\
* A very good anti-siege ship as it can snipe bigger targets with ease.\
*Utilize vertical drifting when facing opponents, this can make it tougher for them to hit your ship. \
== Version History ==\
* Received a buff in update .60d that buffed Hull by 400 and Shields by 600. While also increased slightly in cost to build. The buff was reversed shortly after.\
* Buffed in .63h to add 500 Shield, 100 Hull, and increased the price.\
* Buffed in .66b, with its shields going from 2000 to 3000 and having its turnspeed go from 0.11 to 0.22.\
* Received a remodel and buff in version ???, which increased it's turn speed to 0.5.\
* 1 Large Cannon removed in version .69a1.\
*Explosion Size 100 ----> 320 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Jackal''' can capture a full health [[Frion I]] in 20 minutes.\
* Looks like an orbital gun.\
* On the front screen where the pilot sits it says \"Operation: Devistation\" but devastation is spelled wrong.\
*The heads of the statues in the ship are identical to that of a real-life jackal, which makes sense considering the ship's name.\
*These statues also resemble the Egyptian god, Anubis.\
*Essentially a United States of Razor but almost 1/3 of the price and has more firepower and is not limited.\
*It has a limited time counterpart, the [[Jack-Al'-Lantern|Jack-Al' Lantern]].\
*According to the '''Jackal'''<nowiki/>'s description, it was designed with the same power source as a super capital, namely the [[Hyperion]]. This can be seen on the exterior of the ship, as the core is exposed underneath the ship; and also the interior, with the screen in front of the pilot seat mentioning a 'Hyperion Core'.\

==Description==\
The '''Stealth One''' is a rather small, blocky Battleship heavily armed with 4 Large Torpedoes with the ship's profile that is nearly invisible even against the contrast of a [[Starbase]]. \
\
This ship excels at diving Ships with it's high alpha and long range, as well as being excellent in Sieging for the same reasons.\
==Appearance==\
The Stealth One is a [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ship]], making it's model appear transparent, being nearly invisible in plain sight. The shape of the ship is based of the [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Quinjet Quinjet], a ship from Avengers that also features stealth technology. The ship has 2 large engines in the back along with an open cargo bay door.\
\
This ship has a somewhat large interior that can only be seen from inside, or back of the ship. The majority of the interior is filled with seats which count up to 16, including the pilot seat. The pilots seat is a pretty basic design only containing a seat part and a backrest part. All of this however, despite the appearance of a transparent design of the ship, the interior cannot be seen from the outside.\
==Advantages==\
*Very fast and highly maneuverable for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Four [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Torpedoes]] give this ship a high hull damage output for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Large Torpedoes have an extremely long range of 11,000 Studs.\
*Practically invisible and hard to hit.\
*Small size makes it a small target.\
*Excellent for [[sieging]] [[:Category:Starbase|starbases]] of any level, assuming that it's not being protected.\
*Extremely High [[Galaxy Slang|alpha]] damage makes it incredible for scoring kills from crippled ships.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Very low health for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Very low [[Galaxy Slang|Shield DPS]] compared to Hull DPS.\
*Slow acceleration for its top speed.\
*Slow-firing torpedoes, and torpedoes have slow velocity.\
*Almost unable to engage small and agile ships.\
*Costs 15 [[Stealth Plating]], an item which is hard to obtain.\
==Strategy==\
*Use your insane speed and the ability to hide to your advantage. Stay in constant motion and drift around your enemies so they do not land shots on you.\
*Extremely effective in Sieges as all of its weapons can out-range Starbases and can easily escape when resistance comes.\
*Never get close to [[Galaxy Slang|AA]] Ships like the [[Zeus]], [[Tempest]], [[Ampharos]], or even the [[Hyron]], as they will be your undoing due to their incredibly accurate turrets that could do significant damage to you even with your speed.\
*Use the high firepower on this ship to assault, chase down and finish off vulnerable or isolated capital ships.\
*Whenever you must make an escape from combat however, warp far into empty space ''(but not near the map borders)'' to make your position unpredictable to any enemies that may try to chase you. Note that this strategy may not work well if there is a spy on your team.\
==Version History==\
*In an unknown version the cost was raised from 10 stealth plating to 15 stealth plating.\
*Now has 80% drift .75a12\
*Remodeled by duck_blox .75a12\
*Landing gear removed ''(space ships don't need wheels)'' .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*Has an interior that can only be seen from inside.\
*This ship was actually released about a week before it's main building item [[Stealth Plating]] debuted in the game, making it unobtainable but still on the build menu for a short period of time.\
*This ship is the one of the very first of the stealth ships, being released alongside with the '''[[Stealth B-2]]'''.\

==Description  ==\
The '''2020 Ship''' is a Cruiser and the second ship released following the coming of a new year, the first being the raffle-based [[2018 Ship]]. It went offsale on the same day that the Christmas Event ended.\
== Appearance ==\
This '''2020 Ship''' has quite a small but nicely-decorated interior. Inside, players will see ten memes split across the decade (one from each year, 2010–2019).\
== Advantages ==\
* Highest Combined Health of all Cruisers, at a whopping 4040, even surpassing some Battlecruisers and the [[2018 Ship]].\
* Very unique Spinal pattern, as it's [[Spinals|Phasers]] can go in every direction.\
* Good maneuverability.\
* Capable of holding its own for a limited time.\
* Spinal pattern makes it particularly effective against massive, weakly-defended ships.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Very expensive for a [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]].\
*You will be targeted by those who see it as a prize kill.\
* Can only be obtained once from the quest, and can't be sold.\
* Lack of heavier weaponry limits the combat capabilities of this festive ship against anything in the Cruiser through Dreadnought range.\
== Strategy ==\
* Be incredibly careful while using this, as it is non-refundable and you will <u>'''never'''</u> be able to obtain it again.\
* <u>'''Never'''</u> spawn it during a [[War]].\
* Only spawn it to show off to people.\
* If used against large targets, fly into areas that will maximize the absorption of the unique Spinal pattern.\
== Version History ==\
* Taken off-sale on January 4, 2020.\
* Spinal cooldown heavily increased in unknown version.\
== Trivia ==\
* The NPC that players will need to talk to is on the same Discord server for the game. The confusion is to talk to the NPC (from which gives the 2020 Ship quest) in-game, not the actual player in-game.\
*Was used as a new boss NPC during [[Christmas Event 2021|Christmas 2021]]\
*The number 2020, along with new years is heavily associated with this ship, as the ores required are 2020 uranium, both shields and hull are 2020, the number itself is seen on the sides, and the F spinal shoots 26 Small Phasers in a unique direction representing a firework, as expected for a ship of its name.\
* This ship sells for 48,574 Credits.\
* The first one of these ships to die was infernofire13's to xxErebus. However, due to the glitched nature of the ship a log was not produced. The event is recorded in the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EPDAUwj0fg\
* Was only available for 3 days.\
* Be careful when trying to maximize Spinal effectiveness—flying inside of certain areas of Starbases or Ships can be interpreted as unfair (bannable) exploitation.\
* During an admin event, it was possible to get it, even though it was after it's limited time period.__NOTOC__\
* Was accidentally re-released in the [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] build menu for a few hours on 7/13/2020. Private servers kept this ship buyable for longer even after the bug was patched.\
*Is set ablaze due to 2020's negative outcome.\
*Was released again in the new \"Limited Edition (Permits)\" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a E class permit (310k credits) + 7209 Sillicate, 5865 Carbon, 5587 Iridium along with 11 460manufacturing fee.\

== Description ==\
The '''Razor Wing''' is a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] which, unlike most ships, is asymmetrical due to the large wing on its starboard side. It is also quite well known for its ability to take on large ships, making it good for [[Pirating]] and base defense.\
== Appearance ==\
There is a small energy core pillar directly inside from the doorway, as well as a set of six chairs leading to the front cockpit, which itself has a black pilot's seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Powerful [[Spinals|Spinal]] weaponry that can deal high burst damage.\
* [[Turrets|Light turrets]] help defend against [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]]/[[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]].\
* Two or three of these can possibly take on [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], but only if the pilots are \"extremely skilled\".\
* One of the more affordable '''Battlecruisers'''.\
* Can be used to kill [[Aliens]] with little difficulty. Furthermore, it can heavily damage or even bring down an [[Punisher|Alien Punisher]] if it's unprotected by [[Swarmer|Alien Swarmers]].\
* Potentially unstoppable in a complex fleet.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Low health.\
* Vulnerable bottom.\
* Very well-known, making '''Razor Wings''' a high priority.\
* May struggle against [[ships]] with high health or with lots of high-accuracy [[turrets]].\
* Less [[Shields|Shield]] Damage.\
* \
== Strategy ==\
* You can shoot bigger ships with its ridiculously powerful [[Spinals]] and hit very small [[ships]] with its 2 Flak Cannons.\
* Destroy everyone with your Spinal fury, and watch out for ships like the [[Ampharos]] and the [[Tempest]], whose arrays of small armaments will make mincemeat out of you.\
* Annoy '''Dreadnoughts''' whenever you spot one that can't defend against smaller ships.\
* Swarming is effective: While one is an annoyance, many are outright deadly.\
\
== Version History ==\
* [[Spinals]] nerfed in .60(?) to only 4 barrels. 4 Flaks reduced to 2 Flaks and one Cannon.\
* Remodeled in .61h1(?).\
* Small buff in .64d that added 25 health to each stat, increased turn speed, and raised Cannons to 6 barrels (from 4).\
* Nerfed in version .66b - spinal counts reduced to 3 barrels on both the Cannons and Phasers.\
* Cargo Hold increased from 150 to 300, both spinal counts increased to 4 barrels in version .68e.\
== Trivia ==\
* On the back of the old model, there was an Illuminati decal.\
* One of the most common pirate ships.\
* Often compared to the [[Black Flare]].\
\
* It was one of the five ships that were chosen to be remodeled for the [[Halloween Event 2017]], this one being the [[Blood Wing]].\
\
* It was the only ship remodeled for what could be called the Presidents Day event, with this remodeled Razor Wing being called the [[United States of Razor]].\
* It was remodeled yet again for a [[:Category:Hidden Event|Hidden Event]] on September 16, 2019, this''' '''remodel being named the [[Disruptor]].\
* One of the few ships with an asymmetrical exterior.\
* Currently has the most reskins of any ship.\
* It's exterior is mangled & broken in some parts.\
* Received a nerf removing a turret and nerfing spinals in version .61g.\
* The bottom of the ship looks like it is held together by rods and scrap.\
* Despite its description: <br />      - It uses no palladium in its construction<br />      - Its shield is stronger than its hull<br />      - It does not have a very good hull health for a Battlecruiser.<br />[[File:Razor6.png|right|thumb|220x220px|Old Razor Wing Model.]]\

==Interior==\
Contains a large table in the middle which has a zombie like Frankenstein placed on top of it.\
\
Also contains a generator room at the back of the main room of the ship. The generator room contains two large pink cylinders.\

* Amazing [[Shields|shield]] DPS as well as very good [[hull]] damage make this a versatile ship.\
\
*[[Spinals|Spinal]] [[:Spinals|Phasers]] fire grouped together as one, allowing for pinpoint accuracy and a faster reload than the normal [[Nemesis]].\

*Easy to position ship so that all [[turrets]] have a good line of sight.\
\
*A great all-rounder ship that can siege and PvP.\
*Good health allows it to withstand longer in combat.\
*Good turn speed for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], allowing it to out maneuver most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\

*Rare [[:Category:Limited|limited]] ship puts a huge target on your head.\
*You can't get it back if you lose it.\
*[[Turrets|Turret]] placement is relatively mediocre, you need to aim down slightly to hit all your turrets.\
==Strategy==\
* The '''Frankenemi''' is a good choice for sieging, as it has good acceleration and powerful [[Turrets]] that allow it to quickly enter a chase and destroy a target that is above it.\
==Version History==\
* Received buffs in .60d1 that boosted Shields by 500 and Hull by 500.\
*Received multiple changes during the [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] rebalance. Speed was nerfed, (however, not as much as on the regular [[Nemesis]]) and shields were increased by 1950, while hull was increased by 2450. Turning and acceleration were lowered similarly to all other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], but the exact values are not known to the author.\
*Received a buff in version .66b that increased Max Speed from 38 to 45, Turn Rate from 0.15 to 0.19, Shield and Hull from 5950 to 6350, and replaced turrets with \"Advanced\" counterparts.\
*Buffed in version .66b during the 2019 Halloween Event - Advanced Quad Cannons switched to Heavy Triple Cannons, Front Quantum Laser switched to Heavy Quantum Laser, Medium Spinal switched to Huge\
*It was reintroduced in the 2019 Black Friday Sale and the price was brought up with it.\
*Received a teleporter going from the docking point to the pilot's seat in version .68e.\
*6 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] changed to 6 [[Turrets|Quantum Cannons]] in version .69e.\
*6 Quantum Cannons changed to 6 Triple Heavy Cannons and 2 Quantum Lasers changed to 2 Triple Heavy Lasers in version .73c10.\
*Explosion Size 500 ----> 950 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*While the traditional [[Nemesis]] was changed to a new, larger model, the '''Frankenemi''' retains its smaller, old model thus far.\
*Every now and then it plays a zombie moan noise.\
*Was one of the few event ships brought back for the [[:Category:Black Friday 2019|Black Friday 2019]] sale.\
*The '''Frankenemi''' initially had one of the highest DPS in the game, even higher than some [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]].\

"Spinal_Weaponry","'''Spinal Weaponry, '''informally ''''Spinals',''' are manual weapons that are found on most combat ships. '''Spinals''' can be classified into 3 types: ''Phasers'', ''Cannons'', ''Torpedoes''.\
\
'''Spinal Weaponry''' is aimed manually by the pilot and requires the pilot to fire all shots at a time. Since they do not fire automatically like [[Turrets]] the pilot's ship needs to be pointed towards its target in order to land a hit. There is though a small amount of movement for your spinals depending on where your cursor is. \
\
'''Spinals''' are activated with the keys '''F''' and '''G'''. The key '''F''' is the '''Primary Spinal '''while '''G''' is the '''Secondary Spinal'''.\
\
'''Spinals''' deal high damage per shot, but they have low projectile velocity.\
\
A moving target isn't always easy to hit with large '''Spinals''', which is why [[Pirating|pirates]] prefer small '''Spinals''', as the projectile speed of small '''Spinal Weaponry''' is greater, therefore increasing the reliability against moving targets. However, projectiles in small '''Spinal Weaponry '''has considerably less range.\
\
Most ships are equipped with ''Phasers'' and ''Cannons'' as '''Spinals''', with varying to degrees of firepower. Some ships rely entirely on '''Spinal Weaponry''' for their firepower, while others are equipped with them as a secondary weapon.\
== Phasers ==\
'''''Phasers''''' deal high damage to [[Shields|shield]] but low damage to [[hull]] and move quickly. They appear as a flat, semi-transparent, red-orange beam and make a sharp \"pew\" sound when fired. Upon impact, phasers emit red plasma chunks (with trails) similar to the visual effects seen when damage is dealt to a ship's hull. The sound is repeated for each phaser fired.\

They also give off a tan-white trail when fired, and make a unique noise when fired. Some ships have '''Cannons''' that make a minigun-like noise when fired, most notably the [[Sixfold]].\

'''''Torpedoes''''' are special weapons only found on a select few ships. Some of these ships have unique '''Torpedo''' designs. The only NPC ships with '''Torpedoes''' are the [[Kodiak]] and [[Alien Scout|Scout]].\
\
Their long-range, high damage per hit, and low projectile speed makes them powerful against static and slow targets. Torpedoes do not ignore damage resistance.\

== Trivia ==\
* If a Torpedo hits a player's '''starbase''', the whole faction will be notified with the message \"A Torpedo has hit your base.\" \
* You can see if your torpedo has reloaded by looking in the barrel from where it fires from.\
* Since Torpedoes are ranged, travel slowly, and have high damage, some people prefer it over [[Sieging|Sieges]].\
* The [[Tengu]] used to bear 2 Small Torpedoes before they were replaced with 4 Medium Cannons.\
* The three ships with a Huge Torpedo are the [[Kraken]], [[Hyperion]], and [[Antares]]. ( [[Kraken]] does not have a huge anymore).\
* The [[Kodiak]] used to contain 8 Medium Torpedoes, allowing it to have the highest amount of damage per volley. (4000) before it was replaced with 2 Huge Torpedoes. This change has since been reverted.\
* The [[Hasatan]] used to have 1 Huge Torpedo before it was downsized to 1 Large Torpedo.\
*Some ships have a unique torpedo explosion sound effect, such as the Kraken using a Kraken railgun sound effect and the Hyperion using the sound effect also used for Heavy PDLs, although much more drawn out and louder.\

==Description==\
The '''Santa's Workshop''' is a reskin and buffed variant of the [[M Class]] which was released in part 2 of the 2020 Christmas Event, and then re-released in part 1 of the [[Christmas Event 2021|2021 Christmas Event]].\
==Interior==\
The '''Santa's Workshop''' shares its interior with the M Class, except for some color changes and a Christmas tree.\
==Advantages==\
*Can mine entire [[Ores]] extremely fast with its 5 [[Turrets|M Class Mining Lasers]].\
*Great turn speed for its size.\
*Large Cargo Hold for a [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
*Makes 6K credits in 1 run with 6% [[Loyalty]]. (If you are skilled with warping, 1 run takes around 6 minutes.)\
*2nd-best refundable miner in the game, with the [[Woolly Mammoth]] being 1st.\
*Has more health than its non-limited variant, allowing it to survive longer against pirates and aliens.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Huge size makes it a prime target, even from far away.\
*Cannot mine at a distance; the ore must be inside the \"mouth\" of the ship.\
*A jackpot for [[Pirating|Pirates]], especially [[ships]] with a large Cargo Hold.\
*[[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
*It has a hard time docking when there are two '''Santa's Workshops''', as they can't dock next to each other, and you have to move so your auto dock actually docks.\
*Prevents people on the same faction from attacking the enemy's starbase if inside the \"Mouth\" of the '''Santa's Workshop''' (such use may break rules).\
*Very expensive, being more than quintuple the cost of a regular [[M Class]]; it also costs 100 snowflakes, which can take a while to get.\
*In a test against the Orca, it made money overall about 90% as fast as orca did. This is due to needing to have ores inside the Ship.\
==Strategy==\
*Drive over an [[Ores]], stop, and mine away.\
*Don't mine at [[War]].\
*Always be aware of your surroundings. You will be a massive target.\
*If you're being chased, warp towards a strong [[Starbase]] owned by your faction. The [[Turrets]] on a strong base often ward off attacking [[ships]]. Failure to warp to a [[Starbase]] or the [[Mega Base]] will most likely result in destruction.\
*Try not to become distracted while [[Mining]]. The ship will mine a full-size [[Ores]] chunk in about 20 seconds.\
==Version History==\
*Shields increased from 1000 to 4000, Hull reduced from 3000 to 2500, Ore Hold increased from 4500 to 6500 and size increased in version .70a.\
*Top Speed buffed to 70 and Ore Hold reverted to 4500 to meet ship refund requirements.\
*Model upscaled, Top Speed increased from 72 to 150, Turn Speed increased from 0.5 to 0.6, mining armament changed from 3 M Class Mining Lasers to 5 M Class Mining Lasers, and Ore Hold increased from 6000 to 8000 in version .74b14(?).\
*Shields reduced from 4,000 to 3,000 and Hull increased from 2,500 to 4,000 in version .75a10.\
==Trivia==\
*This ship was re-introduced during the [[Christmas Event 2021|2021 Christmas Event]].\
*Most consider this ship to not be worth getting, as it's time-consuming to gather snowflakes, has a mediocre design, and has very low utility if one already owns a better miner.\
*If you time it correctly, the Workshop can get stuck in any solid object, including ores.\
*Despite it being mentioned that the ore hold was increased to 6500, it was actually increased to 7000.\
*There is a hidden room in the Santa's Workshop located behind the door next to the inner teleporter (Discovered by lord1of2coaos).\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Prepravca''' is a heavy duty [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] with the third highest Cargo Hold of all buildable [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]]. It's very slow and has a large, flat body, making it a big target for [[Pirating|Pirates]].\
\
The main portion of the ship has five large cargo crates, two large side thrusters, and a bubble-like bridge with team-colored glass. This ship can make huge amounts of credits when you used in sync with a large miner like the [[Rorqual]] or [[Mammoth]].\
\
This is effectively the largest [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] in the game for most players until they gain enough credits to buy the [[E Class]] (or the [[Constellation]] for players with [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass]]) as the price difference between the '''Prepravca''' and those ships are massive.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Prepravca's''' interior is identical to that of the [[Prospector]]. The '''Prepravca '''has a decent interior. If you step through the door, there are some stairs to the right next to some crates and a bed. On the upper area, there's a pilot seat with some neon control panels.\
== Advantages ==\
* Third largest buildable [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] Cargo Hold in the game.\
* Decent health for a [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]].\
*Good cargo hold.\
*Decent turn speed.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Slow Acceleration and low Top Speed.\
* Fairly expensive for a [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]].\
* [[Pirating|Pirates]] consider this ship a floating gold pile since it's slow, defenseless, and is almost always seen with a fully loaded Cargo Hold.\
== Strategy ==\
* Remember to never trade while in a [[War]] to avoid being destroyed, as the '''Prepravca''' is very vulnerable to attack. If it's vital that you use it in a war, bring an escort.\
* [[Pirates]] are more likely to wage war on you if you are seen repeatedly using this ship, so be careful when players with high [[Bounty]] are on the server.\
* Bring this to a [[Starbase]] post-siege and you will most likely be able to loot the [[Starbase]] in one run. If possible, try to fly in a \"fleet\" of [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]].\
* When looting a siege, be extremely careful and always have an escort whenever possible, even when docking at the [[Mega Base]].\
== Version History==\
*Rebalanced in .52d, gaining 500 extra Cargo Hold, but losing 100 [[Shields]] and a bit of mobility.\
*In update .53, according to [https://trello.com/b/E0bIEAyS/galaxy Trello], it was reduced by 800 parts due to the lag it caused during warp. It now docks relatively fast and is more optimized.\
*Received buffs in .61e4 that doubled [[Shields]], [[Hull]], and gave the ship minor damage resistance.\
*Received a remodel in version .65a.\
\
* Buffed in .65b - [[Shields|Shield]] increased from 2500 to 3000, [[Hull]] increased from 1500 to 2500, Cargo Hold increased from 2500 to 5000, price increased significantly. Also received a remodel.\
*Cargo hold buffed, increasing it by 2,000 units from 5,000 to 7,000 in version .75a10.\
==Trivia==\
*<nowiki/>'''<nowiki/>'''In etymology, the name derives from the Slovak word, '<nowiki/>''Prepravca'''''<nowiki/>' which''' means 'the transporter', which is a fitting name for this large [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] ship.\
*The current model of '''Prepravca''' is similar to a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_carrier Bulk Ship]. A common ship used by merchants for trading Ores.\
*Its current model looks like an elongated [[Prospector]] or one half of a [[D Class]].\
*'''''Please update the images for old models - Drivethecar54'''''\
*Has the same amount of health as the [[Patriotic Hercules]].\

The '''Stealth B-2''' is a rather small, sleek Battleship that is nearly invisible even against the contrast of a [[Starbase]]. It has a design inspired by real life American B-2 bombers, however the ships design is quite hard to see due to its invisibility.\
\
This ship excels at diving Ships with it's high alpha and long range, as well as being excellent in Sieging for the same reasons.\
==Appearance==\
[[File:StealthB-2-firing.png|thumb|left|Stealth B-2 Firing torpedoes]]\
The Stealth B-2 is a [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ship]], making it's model appear transparent, being nearly invisible in plain sight. The shape of the ship is based off the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit B-2 Spirit Bomber] that also features stealth technology. The ship has a flat, but wide profile, with wingspan being extremely long. The torpedoes have small trails coming from them when moving fast.\
\
The Interior is a small, empty room with a seat on the middle, but is difficult to spot.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
==Advantages==\
*Very fast and highly maneuverable for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*10 [[Spinal Weaponry|Small Torpedoes]] give this ship a high hull damage output for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Small Torpedoes have a long range of 9,000 Studs.\
*Practically invisible and hard to hit.\
*Rather small size, and flat profile, along with its speed makes it difficult to get hit.\
*Cheaper than the other cloaked ship in the game, the [[Stealth One]], costing only 10 [[Stealth Plating]] instead of 15.\
*Amazing against large capital ships and starbases.\
*Invisible on the minimap making it great for ambushes and escape.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Very low health for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Very low [[Galaxy Slang|Shield DPS]] compared to Hull DPS.\
*Slow-firing torpedoes, and torpedoes have slow velocity.\
*Almost unable to engage small and agile ships.\
*Torpedoes are lined up along the ship, with some far away from the center, making it hard to hit targets that are close.\
*Costs 10 [[Stealth Plating]], an item which is hard to obtain.\
==Strategy==\
*Use your insane speed and the ability to hide to your advantage. Stay in constant motion and drift around your enemies so they do not land shots on you.\
*Extremely effective in Sieges as all of its weapons can out-range Starbases and can easily escape when resistance comes.\
*Never get close to [[Galaxy Slang|AA]] Ships like the [[Zeus]], [[Tempest]], [[Ampharos]], or even the [[Hyron]], as they will be your undoing due to their incredibly accurate turrets that could do significant damage to you even with your speed.\
*Use the high firepower on this ship to assault, chase down and finish off vulnerable or isolated capital ships.\
*Turn your B-2 90 Degrees from its axis then Drift, but with Z and C, this makes it much more harder for enemies to hit you.\
*Powerful for [[Pirating]] because of its invisibilty, high [[Galaxy Slang|Alpha Damage]] and speed.\
*Whenever you must make an escape from combat however, warp far into empty space ''(but not near the map borders)'' to make your position unpredictable to any enemies that may try to chase you. Note that this strategy may not work well if there is a spy on your team.\
==Version History==\
*Remodeled in Version ??? by MastroyPro.\
*Torpedo count increased from 4/4 to 5/5, shield increased from 750 to 900, hull halved from 1000 to 500 in version .75a3\

*Has an interior that can only be seen from inside.\
*This ship is based on the real life [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit '''Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit Bombers'''] manufactured from 1987 to 2000.\

* The [[Monogram|Monogram's]] mention of \"red ice\" could be a reference to abused substances seen in video games, most recently appearing as a widely abused substance in ''Detroit: Become Human''.\
* The [[Monogram]] appears to be hiding around the corner of the wall between the holographic display and area where '''Richard Kavar''' has partly collapsed.\
* The dialogue bubble above the [[Monogram]] is blue rather than red, signifying that it is not ''required'' for the quest.[[File:KavarMonogram1.png|thumb|700x700px|centre]]\

== Description==\
The '''Retro Prototype X-1''' is a \"test dreadnought\" based on the [[Prototype X-1]], part of the [[Retro Ship Event 2022]] where you could buy it from the UNE Harbour Master in Terminal C of the [[Mega Base]].\
==Interior==\
???\
==Advantages==\
*High turret count with an armament well-equipped for [[Sieging|Sieges]].\
*Powerful [[Spinals]].\
*Health is well-balanced and has a very high overall total for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], at 19,250 total HP; making it the second most healthy dreadnought in the game.\
*Spinals have 0 second interval, meaning they are fired all at once.\
*Long range on the turrets(8,000 studs) allows you to outrange most other ships you will encounter.\
*Large cargo hold will allow you to loot valuable items fairly well from NPC ship wrecks.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Rather slow with low maneuverability.\
*Extremely valuable target for superior ships such as super capitals, or groups of pirates; thanks to the outrageously expensive cost of 2 million credits(and 1 Blueprint B), as well as being a [[:Category:Limited|Limited]] ship.\
*Large blind-spots below and behind the ship.\
*'''''<u>Massive</u>''''' size makes this ship a very easy target to hit for even the most inaccurate turrets or pilots with poor spinal aiming capabilities; not to mention [[Spinal Weaponry|Torpedoes]].\
==Strategy==\
*This is a decent ship for diving battleships and other dreadnoughts when they flee to their base, tank with your health.\
*Do not try to move out of the way of [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Torpedoes]] with regular ship movement alone, as the ship is too large and too sluggish to dodge them. Instead, warp out of the way of any Huge or Large Torpedoes that you see coming towards you.\
*This ship is heavily targeted due to its expense and limited status. As mentioned in the ship's description, use with extreme caution.\
==Version History==\
*Health changed from 9,500/9,500 Shield/Hull HP to 10,750/8,500 Shield/Hull HP, Top Speed reduced from 50 to 45, Turn Speed reduced from 0.12 to 0.1, Acceleration reduced from 12 to 5, Cargo Hold reduced from 1000 to 348, turret loadout changed from 5 Medium Siege Railguns and 4 Super LR Lasers to 5 Prototype Medium Railguns and 4 Prototype Heavy Lasers, [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] changed from 4 Huge Cannons and 5 Huge Phasers to 6 Huge Cannons and 6 Huge Phasers as well as the spinal interval being removed, and released in the Retro Ship 2022 event for the cost of 2 million credits and 1 Blueprint B as a quest from the UNE Harbour Master in version .75a5.\
*Taken off-sale in version .75a5 after the end of the Retro 2022 Event.\
*Cargo Hold increased from 348 to 1500 in version .75a5.\
*Turrets buffed: Prototype Heavy Laser damage increased from 150 to 151.75, reload decreased from 10 seconds to 4.6 seconds; and Prototype Medium Railgun damage increased from 150 to 298.91, reload decreased from 10 seconds to 8 seconds, and Spinals nerfed from 6/6 Huge Phasers/Huge Cannons to 4/4 Huge Phasers/Cannons in version .75a5.\
==Trivia==\
*One of the most expensive Dreadnoughts released to date at an outstanding cost of 2 million credits and 1 Blueprint B.\
*Used to have more health than the [[Theia]] before it received a health buff.\
*This ship is the original model of the Prototype X-1.\
*A video showing this ship in action can be seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ShMf1hBeZ0 here], by Rocket_GotG.\
* The first '''Retro Prototype X-1''' to die was '''sumenghang123''' to USS_monkey's Prototype X-2.\

"Warehouse","== Description ==\
The '''Warehouse''' is where all materials for building ships are stored. Ships can be built at any outpost, but can only be built using materials in the '''Warehouse'''. Though the contents of the '''Warehouse''' can be seen in any location, ores can only be added to or removed from the '''Warehouse''' while players are inside of the [[Mega Base]]. Materials can be put in the '''Warehouse''' by either:\
\
'''A)''' Directly buying them from the [[Mega Base]] into your '''Warehouse'''.\
\
''or''\
\
'''B)''' Using a trade ship to transport materials from your home base or wrecks to the [[Mega Base]] and transferring the items directly from the ship to your '''Warehouse'''.\
\
Once the correct amount of [[Materials]] is in the '''Warehouse''', ships can be purchased, as long as you can also pay the up-front manufacturing fee.\
\
'''Warehouses''' are upgradeable, with each level increasing the total storage available in your '''Warehouse''' as shown in the table below.\
*[[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] require a level 8-15 Warehouse to create.\
* [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] require a level 9-21 '''Warehouse'''.\
* [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] require a level 4-16 level '''Warehouse'''. <br />\
The New Player Protection in Galaxy is directly dependent on '''Warehouse''' levels. A player is titled as a \"New Player\" if they have a level '''one''' '''Warehouse'''. If a player has this protection, you cannot attack any of their [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] or [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]]-class ships. Once a \"New Player's\" '''Warehouse''' is upgraded to level '''two''', ''all'' of their ships become vulnerable to player attacks. The warehouse automatically upgrades once a certain number of credits is reached, saying that, \"Congratulations! You are no longer a new player!\" upon rejoining. \
\
Prior to the '''Warehouse''' update, ships were built using materials deposited in your own Starbase. All of the ore that [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] brought in were stored in a base's \"Cargo hold,\" as it were. It was almost impossible to get a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] unless you locked a faction and played for 3+ hours in order to collect that much ore uninterrupted, not to mention the considerable manufacturing cost of making such large ships back then. Because ores were not purchased, players essentially had to pay the full price in their own credits in one straight purchase, rather than the way '''Warehouses''' let players ''gradually'' collect and pay for ore for ships.\
\
Players can only have up to 150,000 of any ore in their warehouse; if the player places more ore in their warehouse, the game will remove it upon joining a new server. This ore is likely lost and will not be sold for any compensation, so players should avoid gathering too much ore at once.\

The '''''Antares''''' is a '''[[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]''' that was part of the second stage of the [[Christmas Event 2019|2019 Christmas Event]] and was re-introduced in the [[Christmas Event 2022|<span style=\"color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;\">Christmas Event 2022</span>]].\
\
==Description==\
The '''''Antares''''' is a long range and hard hitting [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], just like its little sister [[Aludra]].\
\
It excels at obliterating hulled ships with its massive hull-based firepower.\
== Appearance==\
The '''Antares''' is long but thin [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] that has a shape that resembles a submarine, with detailing and design extremely similar to its little sister [[Aludra]], with various plating, pipes, and even grills detailed on the ship. On the back has its prominent \"Orb\" which is its most recognizable feature. \
\
The Interior of the '''Antares''' is a nicely detailed small room with walls covered in ice and a snowflake symbol. On the middle of the room can be found the pilot seat which is facing a screen.\
== Advantages==\
*Very high health for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
*Extremely long range, making it suitable for [[Strategies|Sieging]].\
*Insane hull damage output, at a Hull DPS of 412, making '''Antares''' an amazing diving ship.\
*Slim frame when pointing towards targets making it harder to hit.\
*High alpha makes it great for diving ships.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Slow maneuverability.\
*Large blind-spot at the back of the ship, where there is little to no firepower.\
*Struggles engaging against small ships.\
* Little to no shield-based weapons means it will do little to no damage against shields.\
== Strategy==\
*Prioritize hulled targets, or ships with hull-based health such as the [[Armageddon]].\
*Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.\
*During a siege, stay out of base range and shoot your [[Spinal Weaponry|Torpedoes]].\
*Learn how far ahead of your targets you need to fire your torpedoes to hit them, and adjust based on their speed. Torpedoes do a lot of damage and aiming them properly can help you destroy ships much faster.\
*Use your high range to your advantage in Sieges.\
*It is very hard to take out small ships with this so bring [[Galaxy Terminology|AA]] support with you.\
*Bring a shield shredder like the [[Zeus]] or [[Sagittarius]] with you to quickly cripple or destroy enemy capital ships.\
== Version History==\
*Buffed in version .75a5. 1 medium flak and 1 dual cannon were swapped out for 2 Heavy Icy Artillery Cannons. 2 heavy point defense lasers swapped out for 2 Super LR lasers. Torpedo interval reduced to 0.1. Speed buffed to 60 and acceleration buffed to 15. Turn speed was buffed to 0.15. Hull health increased from 6000 to 6500.\
*Hull and Shields buffed to 8,800 and 7,200 in an unknown verwsion\
*Re-released during the [[Christmas Event 2022|<span style=\"color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;\">Christmas Event 2022</span>]] in version 75a37.\
==Trivia==\
*Has a little sister; The [[Aludra]].\
*Most of its turrets are what seems to be Myriad's, but colored differently.\
*One of the few ships to have [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Torpedoes]].\
*In its description it says that the Ice Monster raised the ship from ice sheets, while with every other [[:Category:Christmas 2019|2019 Christmas]] ship has been taken over by the Ice ''(except for the [[Snowfall]])''.\
*The first player to lose an '''Antares''' was Krusadr007, to an [[Atlas]].\
*Despite its name, it is not related to the [[Antares Comet]] ''(Part of the [[:Category:Christmas 2020|Christmas 2020]] event)'', which was known for crashing into [[Aqueous II]], in addition to offering the [[Crystocrene]] for 75 snowflakes and 150k credits.\

==Description==\
The '''Alpha Ship''' is a Carrier easily recognizable because of its large size and color scheme.\
\
It carries 6 completely unique [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]], all miniature versions of Alpha/early Beta models.\
\
Each fighter is as follows: [[Mini Alpha Warlock]], [[Mini Beta Behemoth]], [[Mini Alpha Naglfar]], [[Mini Alpha Leviathan]], [[Mini Beta Andromeda]], and [[Mini Alpha Cyclops]].\
==Interior==\
The '''Alpha Ship''''s Interior consists of a detailed bridge with a pilot's seat, screens and two teleporters. Sitting in the pilot's chair the teleporter on the right sends you to a box with 2 red bunk beds and a screen with a 3D view of the alpha ship. The teleporter on the left sends you to the hanger, before you reach the fighters there is a 3D hologram showing the Alpha ship fighting an Alien fleet.\
==Advantage==\
*High health.\
*Free for Alpha badge owners.\
*Only carries 6 Fighters, making full utilization easier.\
*Powerful Fighters that can deal insane damage if all are used.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Must be at a closer range to deal effective [[Hull]] damage.\
*The '''Alpha Ship''' is a large target making it an easy target for [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]].\
*Only players that have the Alpha Badge or other proof can get it; requires asking an admin.\
*Cannot be re-obtained outside of a proper refund.\
*Heavy Lasers are ineffective against small [[Ships]], especially at long-range.\
*Vulnerable underside.\
*Low maneuverability.\
*Rather underwhelming firepower in general, the ship struggles to even destroy a large [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] without the support of its fighters.\
==Strategy==\
*Be careful and know what [[Ships]] you can safely take on based on the situation.\
*Warp in, deploy your Fighters, and warp out.\
*Siege bases using your Fighters.\
==Version History==\
*Health increased from 8000/8000 to 10000/9000 in version .68d.\
*Received a buff in version .71b, increasing its Hull from 9000 to 9001.\

*The strongest Hull-breaker and highest overall DPS fighter on board the '''Alpha Ship''' is the Mini Cyclops, while the strongest Shield-breaker is the Mini Naglfar.\
*Modified from an unused [[Revelation]] remodel submission.\
*A single '''Alpha Ship''' was given away through the Galaxy Wikia Discord Server to a non-alpha player.\
*The first person to lose an '''Alpha Ship''' was MrClassyTurtle.\
*Has 6 Fighters: The Mini Alpha Cyclops, Mini Beta Andromeda, Mini Alpha Leviathan, Mini Alpha Warlock, Mini Alpha Naglfar, and the Mini Beta Behemoth, each with unique stats.\
*The turrets are unique, remodeled Alpha Turrets.\
*Believed by many to be the most common limited ship in the game as there are 165067 Alpha Ships that exist or have existed. most of which are yet to be claimed.[[File:RobloxScreenShot20200924 191807045.png|thumb|220x220px|Sleeping Quarters]][[File:RobloxScreenShot20200924 191744857.png|thumb|220x220px|Pilot Seat]]\
* This ship is heavily targeted by factions and pirates. Many players lose this ship quickly after getting it. Some during the same day.\

==Description==\
The '''Bombe''' is an incredibly powerful joke ship with the worst accuracy of any ship in the game, configured in such a way that its ridiculously high damage-per-second can never be unleashed as it is mathematically impossible for the ship's turrets to hit a shot.\
\
To obtain the ship, you had to talk to an [[Advanced Ship Computers|advanced ship computer]] at the end of a hidden maze inside [[Pyramus]]. The hint given by developer GodrevyD, as with everything else associated with the ship, was fully written in binary. When translated, it read; \
\
''\"--Added a new ship for enigma demotion soon TM if you figured out how to get the text from this good work the quest is on a planet go find\".''\
\
After completing the quest at [[Pyramus]], you will be charged 10,000 credits and given the '''Bombe'''.\
==Interior==\
The Bombe has no interior, just a seat on top of the ship.\
==Advantages==\
*Highest DPS of any playable ship.\
*Very high health for it's class.\
*High speed.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Huge target for pirates.\
*Will '''NEVER''' hit a shot, no matter the circumstances.\
==Strategy==\
*Troll your enemies by getting people to use the :info command on the Bombe, so they see its stunning DPS, before spawning it.\
*Do not be fooled by its power. It will lose any and every fight it gets into.\
*Roleplay as an advanced ship computer?\

==Trivia==\
*The binary on the model of the [[Advanced Ship Computers|advanced ship computer]] that gives the '''Bombe''' translates to \"trolling\".\
*The description of the ship translates to \"This trolling\".\
*The \"[[wikipedia:Bombe#:~:text=The bombe (UK: /b,messages during World War II.|Bombe]]\" was a supercomputer created by Alan Turing during World War 2, designed to decipher the German encryption known as the \"[[wikipedia:Enigma machine#:~:text=The Enigma machine is a,branches of the German military.|Enigma]]\".\
**This is the reasoning for the ship's name, as it was released on the anniversary of the [[Enigma Cache Incident]]. It also explains the ship's appearance.\
*The ship is a jab at how people often jump to conclusions about how good or bad a ship is based on its damage output, rather than considering its range, health, speed, or accuracy.\
**While the ship has ludicrously high damage, it's tracking accuracy is set to such a high number that the game cannot comprehend it and sets the value to 0. Because of how Galaxy's combat works, this means even if the projectile makes contact with the target, it will never deal any damage.\

==Description==\
The Galleon is the second-strongest Pirate boss. It has a large focus on hull health and damage, and is rather powerful against single opponents. It had blindspots at the back, and it moves sideways. It is not to be underestimated by Battleships or some Dreadnoughts.\
\
Galleon has a massive amount of Dps when compared to other ships of its class.\
\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Galleon''' is mostly brown, with some more metallic coloring for some parts of the ship. Its design somewhat resembles a sci-fi spaceship twist on a 1950s American streamlined locomotive.\
==Behavior==\
The '''Galleon''' is a broadside ship and will try to align its broadside to face you. It also will call in Pirate ships, similar to the [[Kodiak]] and other pirate bosses. It has a relatively strong nuke, at around 4k studs of blast radius and 1k damage.\
\
It spawns every 40 minutes with no player count limit in both private and public servers.\
==Strategy==\
* Stay behind or in front of the '''Galleon''' as it is a broadside ship. It is also recommended to use hull breaker ships, as it is a hull tank with low shields. If there are few or no other pirates, the Galleon can be destroyed solo with a strong [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] such as the [[Kraken]], a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]], or a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]]. \
* Avoid using hull-tanking ships to fight the '''Galleon''', as both the it and other [[Pirates]] deal high amounts of damage to hull. A high damaging shield tank such as the [[Lazarus]] or [[Obliterator]] is excellent for this purpose. \
* Alternatively, it can be brought to a [[Starbase]] or [[:Category:Planets|Planet]] to assist in killing it. This can help remove any other [[Pirates]] as well.\
* Its [[Turrets]] have terrible accuracy, however, its [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] do not. Stay away from the sides if possible.\
*The '''Galleon''' is extremely weak to long range ships such as the [[Judgement]], [[Kraken]], [[Avalon]] or even an [[Archeon]]. Use your [[Turrets]] and [[Spinal Weaponry|Torpedoes]] at a distance, and warp away slightly if it catches up to you. It may take longer, but is effective if your ship can’t last long in heavy fire. \
*Avoid making it turn it's back as it's spinals will have a line of sight and will melt your shield. \
*Use A fast ship such as The [[Nightmare]] To Orbit around the ship and fire on it with your spinals. However Watch out for the escorting Pirates' as they have Flak Cannons that can easily kill your ship. \
==Loot==\
The '''Galleon''' drops 6 [[Plasma Battery]] and 150 [[Armor Scrap]], and 1200 [[Material Scrap]]. Attacking it solo can give over 30k [[Credits]] in combat rewards.\
==Version History==\
* Added in .72f1\
*Disabled from spawning upon the release of the first part of Halloween 2021 for obvious reasons.\
* Re-enabled from spawning in version .74b17, spawns every 54 minutes instead, with Armored Platings in the loot being changed to 150 Armor Scraps.\
*Plasma Battery amount tripled (2 --> 6) in version .74b17.\
*Disabled from spawning during Christmas 2021 event for obvious reasons, it was re-enabled a few days after the event ended.\
*Disabled from spawning due to being replaced by 2 Pirate [[Waspinator]]s during the April Fools event 2022 in version .75a9. This was later reverted after the conclusion of the event.\
==Trivia==\
* Looks like an Emperor-class Battleship from Warhammer 40k.\
* Uses an old model of the [[Armageddon]].\
*Due to the fact that broadsiding AI would require a different movement pattern, the Galleon simply moves sideways to fire its spinals, which makes warping and turning very strange looking.\
*Galleon destruction can be a useful way of earning credits, since Plasma Batteries can be used for Uranium at the Mega Base, or for [[Credits]] at both the [[Mega Base]] and [[Pyramus]]. 500 Armor Scraps can be turned in for 75000 credits. Depending on how much damage you deal you may get a good amount of Combat Rewards as well.\
*The [[Zhen]] is capable of taking down the Galleon solo, however, it is recommended to destroy the pirate fleet first.\

}}\
==Description==\
The '''Rapture''' is a strangely-shaped [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] with many odd, mystical-looking decorations placed around the ship. It features four arced structures that come to a point past the back of the ship and a thinner nose area that connects to Starbase docking points. \
\
The '''Rapture''' carries 3 [[Striker]]s and 3 [[Inflictor]]s.\
== Appearance ==\
The entrance is a teleporter shaped like an elongated sphere located in a small tunnel in the nose. This takes players to the fighter bay. On the roof of the hangar, it says \"Release the Seventh Seal\".\
\
At the end of the hangar is a larger teleporter that leads to bridge.\
\
The '''Rapture''' has a nice fighter bay with fancy pillars and decorations.\
\
The bridge contains a big screen in front of the pilot's seat and a clear floor with a reactor core under the pilot's seat.\
==Advantages==\
* High health and [[Turrets|Heavy Siege Railguns]] give it the ability to tank fire and attack during [[Sieging|Sieges]], especially against hulled bases.\
* Somewhat cheap for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
* Essentially a siege [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] with fighters.\
* [[Turrets|Heavy Siege Railguns, and Super LR Lasers]] give it decent long-range firepower.\
* Highest alpha damage for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] thanks to the heavy-hitting, long-range turrets.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Somewhat vulnerable bottom.\
* Huge blind spots, requiring accurate aiming for all [[Turrets]] to have a line of sight.\
* [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] damage are not balanced, as it mostly relies on its [[Frenzy|Frenzies]] to do shield damage.\
* It is large and slow, making it an easy target to hit.\
* Has a hard time defeating smaller [[Ships]] without its [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
==Strategy==\
* Do not engage an enemy base without the help of your [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] pilots or allied [[ships]].\
* Work with your [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] and tank while your [[Fighter Swarming|Fighters]] dish out shield damage.\
* Tell your teammates to fly the [[Frenzy|Frenzies]] in groups so they will be more effective, as there are only six(Or, spend Robux on obtaining 6 [[AI Fighters]]).\
* Never go alone without your faction using your [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]]. Without support, you could be ambushed with ease.\
* Use the ship to tank for your fleet [[Starbase]]s or Planets in [[Sieging|Siege]] situations.\
* Watch out for experienced fleets that want to destroy you.\
* If you are far enough away, you can snipe people at ungodly ranges.\
* Use this ship's high alpha damage to decimate smaller [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] or [[:Category:Miner|Miners]], since those have low resistance to damage.\
==Version history==\
*Health increased from 6000/6750 to 6500/9000, 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]] replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]] in version .68d.\
*Heavy Point Defense Lasers replaced with Heavy LR Lasers, 2 Medium Railguns replaced with 2 Heavy Railguns, shield increased from 6500 to 7500 in version .73b3\
*Fighter loadout changed from 6 Frenzies to 3 Strikers and 3 Frenzies(someone please confirm that this change wasn't done in the same version as the one right above), Turret Loadout changed from 4 Medium Railguns, 2 Heavy Railguns, and 2 Heavy LR Lasers to 5 Heavy Siege Railguns and 3 Super LR Lasers, Shield and Hull health changed from 7,500/9,000 to 9,500/8,500 respectively, and Cargo Hold nerfed from 150 to 10 in version .74b14(?).\
==Trivia==\
* The interior of the '''Rapture''' contains many strange, eye-shaped symbols.\
* Can easily solo a level 2 base with no defense and only 2 deployed fighters.\
* In the chamber where the fighters are located it states \"Release The Seventh Seal\" on the ceiling.\
* The '''Rapture '''resembles the rear end of a Covenant CSO class supercarrier from Halo.\
* The '''Rapture''' has the highest alpha owned by a carrier.\
*The '''Rapture''' shares many similarities with the [[Judgement]] like it's high alpha damage and low dps.(without fighters at least)\

}}\
==Description==\
The '''Revelation''' is a massive [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]], larger than most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], and has a large interior.\
== Appearance==\
The '''Revelation''' is a massive, long Carrier that has one of the largest interiors in the game.\
\
The '''Interior''' is a large, carpeted area but mostly empty to reduce lag. In the middle of it you will find a sign that says \"Rev Cafe\" and a Menu next to the cafeteria. If you walk down the hallway, you will end up in a large, but empty room with a window out the front and a teleporter to the hangar. There are a few seats in them facing out of the windows.\
\
The '''Bridge''' is fairly small and has a window in the back. There are a few seats near the pilot and a seat behind facing a glass table, taken from the old [[Apocalypse]]. The pilot's seat has a blue orb in front of it, supposedly the steering wheel.\
\
The '''Fighter Bay''' is an area in which contains 6 [[Striker]]s lined up in a row. On the back end of the hangar, you find a teleporter to the bridge.\
==Advantages==\
*High [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower makes it well-defended against attackers.\
*Can support fleets in a large scale siege.\
*Able to resist attacks from [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] for a limited amount of time due to its high health.\
*With some skill, the '''Revelation''' can PvP some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] without needing the support of its [[Striker|Fighters]].\
*Has a monstrous damage per second of '''920''' if all fighters are used.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Sluggish mobility.\
*Can be overwhelmed by smaller [[Ships]] if the blindspot under the ship remains undefended.\
*Very large and makes a huge target for enemy [[Ships]].\
*Lacks the maneuverability to flee from critical situations.\
*Long way from the seats to the fighters due to having no teleporters in between them.\
==Strategy==\
*Don't go into open spaces because you can be ambushed by smaller [[Ships]].\
* Make sure your team listens to your orders. If your team is good enough, they can use [[Striker]]s to burn through a base's [[Shields|Shield]].\
*Stay behind siege ships. [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] provide excellent cover.\
*Only charge when [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] charge. Otherwise, focus on guiding the [[Turrets|Laser Turrets]] instead of [[Turrets|Cannons]].\
== Version History==\
*Price and health buff in an unknown version.\
*Its interior was stripped in version .61g to decrease part count.\
*Received a remodel and health raised from 5500/5500 to 6000/6000 in version .65b.\
*Shield increased from 6000 to 10000 and loadout changed to 1 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Laser]], 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]], 4 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]] in version .68d.\
*All 6 Furies replaced with Strikers in version .73a3\
*Turret loadout Changed from 2 Heavy Point Defence Lasers, 4 Heavy Flak Cannons, 2 Heavy Lasers, and 1 Light Flak Cannon to 2 Triple Heavy Lasers, 2 Heavy LR Lasers, 2 Triple Medium Cannons, 2 Heavy Cannons, and 1 Light Flak Cannon; as well as the cargo hold being nerfed from 1200 to 160 in version .73a3.\
*1 Extra Light Flak Cannon added(1 Light Flak Cannon --> 2 Light Flak Cannons) in an unknown version.\
* Model part count reduced from 724 parts to 51 parts in version .75a5(?).\
* Sideways teleporters fixed in version .75a5.\
== Trivia==\
*Featured on the main thumbnail for Galaxy.\
*Shares the same [[Striker|Fighters]] as [[Frion I]]'s Lucifer Station, [[Rapture]] and [[Rhino]].\
*There is a ship that uses a modified version of the '''Revelation's '''original model, [[Alpha Ship]].\
*The teleporters have broken several times.\
*A [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] variant called the [[Revylation 🦍|Revylation]] was a downscaled version of this ship.\

The '''''Prototype X-3''''' is a [[:Category:Miner|Miner-Class]] April Fools' ship.\
==Description==\
The '''Prototype X-3''' is a former hidden Quest ship until that was later put onto the limited build menu for a short period of time. It carries an [[Turrets|X-3 Colossus Cannon]] and a [[Turrets|X-3 Colossus Laser]].\
==Appearance==\
The '''Prototype X-3'''<nowiki/>'s design resembles the Wasp but has a unique, more militaristic model. Just like the Wasp, this ship has no interior; players simply walk out onto the seat in the center of the ship which is completely open to space.\
== Advantages ==\
*Absurdly high speed, acceleration, and maneuverability. \
*Small size.\
*No loyalty or base level requirement.\
*Can receive invulnerability from bases when docked.\
*Ridiculously strong nuke of 1000.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Pitiful health and damage resistance.\
*Poor accuracy.\
*Pathetic ore hold of 21.\
== Strategy ==\
* Treat this ship as a trophy, as it is a high value target, is not of much use in combat, and cannot be reobtained.\
* If you're going to use it, try to only fight big targets which can't hit you due to your 300 speed and small size.\
*Fly near your targets so your turrets can hit them, otherwise they will often miss.\
==Version History ==\
*Released in version .65b for 2 weeks as part of a “potential” April Fool's Day prank. The April Fool's Day prank was later confirmed true within a week of its announcement through the obtaining of it via a small rectangular container located a distance of 146k to 150k studs directly above the [[Mega Base]].\
*Re-added for a limited time in version .66b, nobody managed to get it within that period.\
* Ship reclassified to Miner and Advanced AutoCannon replaced by Colossus Cannon in .72d.\
*Unique icon removed and replaced with a normal [[Wasp]] icon in an unknown version.\
*Buffed to 1000/1000 health, 300 speed, 0.9 turnspeed, received stealth technology and heavily buffed turret DPS, and turret accuracy nerfed to be the most unprecise turret of the game in an unknown version.\
*Buffed to 3000/3000 health, turret class changed to mining turret, and 5 additional turrets added in an unknown version.\
*Turret count reverted to 1 in an unknown version.\
* Received an X-3 Colossus Laser in an unknown version.\
*Nerfed DPS, removed stealth technology and health changed to 1000/1 in an unknown version.\
*Added to limited build menu in an unknown version.\
*Removed from limited build menu in an unknown version.\
*Unique icon re-added in an unknown version.\
==Trivia==\
*The quest for it said that 7 million [[Credits]], a [[Weapons Part]], and an [[Alien Device]] were required, but in reality, you just needed around 7 Credits to get it.\
**However, if you had the requested items above, the quest would take them from you.\
*Despite bearing a name similar to the [[Prototype X-1]] and the [[Prototype X-2]], which are both [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]], '''Prototype X-3''' is actually a [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
* The first player to kill one was Birdhunter100.\
*One of the [[Galaxy Staff|Developers]], Arina, mentioned that if Galaxy won a Bloxy Award, they would add a battle [[Wasp]] to the game. Galaxy did not win a Bloxy Award, but this might be the battle Wasp Arina was talking about.\
\
*The room in which you got the quest was meant to be accessed with an extremely well-hidden teleporter. However, it was eventually discovered to be about 146 thousand studs above the [[Mega Base]], where most people got it.\
*Back when it first came out, it could be sold for roughly 2 Million credits, though you would be banned for doing so. (Note: selling it after buying it for full price was not bannable.)\
*Was released a second time on 9/17/2019 for one day. It was hidden inside a large uranium in one of the corners, and to access the quest you needed to upgrade myriad to level 2. Nobody was able to get it in that time period.\
*Was put into the limited build menu on 2021, the materials required were 181 silicate, 140 carbon, 117 iridium, 9 adamantite, 27 palladium, 14 titanium, 14 quantium, 11 uranium, and a Class E Permit.\
*The Ship has a massive icon on the minimap, despite being extremely small.\
*The ship is classed as a miner, however, if used on the UNE team, will use a supercapital icon.\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Skeletal Ghostealis '''is a reskin of the [[Borealis]] that carries unique long range [[Wraith]] [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]], which are reskins of the [[Blitz]].\
\
This [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] excels at [[Sieging]] and Siege support as it's fighters have long range torpedoes and the Carrier itself has enough turret firepower to act as a support.\
==Appearance==\
The '''Skeletal Ghostealis''' is a long and tall carrier. Unlike the [[Borealis]]. this variant is translucent and has an orange and brown color palette. There are also skull ornaments decorating it's Skeletal Cannon and Laser turrets.\
\
The '''<u>Interior</u>''' of the '''Skeletal Ghostealis '''is taken up entirely by the fighter bay. There are hallways connecting on each fighter hangar and the bridge is simply a pilot seat located in one end of the fighter bay, adjacent to a teleporter leading outside. \
== Advantages ==\
* Large health pool.\
* Large amount of Long range, powerful [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* Good Cargo Hold.\
*Has very high [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
*Good for sieges, as the fighters have long range torpedoes ''(9k Studs)'' and balanced damage.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Poor mobility.\
* Requires a high [[Warehouse]] level and has a very expensive material cost.\
* Unlike it's [[Borealis|Regular counterpart]], it costs more than the [[Nyx|Nyx's]] [[Ghoul Nyx|Halloween Counterpart]].\
*Unable to fire all it's turrets at once, at any direction the ship points.\
*Extremely large and easy to hit, especially from above or beside it.\
==Strategy ==\
*Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.\
*Use it's fighters for outranging Large [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]]  and [[Sieging]] [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]]/[[:Category:Planets|Planets]] and as the torpedoes are long range.\
*If you have to fight, stay below the enemy so majority of your turrets can fire, and take down [[Galaxy Slang|AA]] Ships with your turret firepower like the [[Ampharos]] and [[Hyron]] which can shred your [[Wraith|Fighters]].\
*'''Never''' use as your main ship. This is a high kill for [[Pirating|Pirates]].\
*'''NEVER '''use this ship for tanking damage. The rarity of it alone makes it a massive target.\
== Version History==\
*Added in .65a.\
*4 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Lasers]] and 2 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]], 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]], 4 [[Turrets|Skeletal Cannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Skeletal Lasers]], [[Wraith]] spawns reduced from 16 to 6 and received a remodel in version .69e.\
*Removed 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]], 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]], and replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Advanced Medium AutoLasers]] and 2 [[Turrets|Quantum Cannons]] in an unknown version.\
==Trivia==\
*Added for the [[Halloween Event 2018]].\
*The '''Skeletal Ghostealis'''' [[Wraith|Fighters]] are the only ones of their class to have trails.\
*The first person to lose a '''Skeletal Ghostealis''' was [https://www.roblox.com/users/135592866/profile MegaVikron] , to [https://www.roblox.com/users/34642665/profile badman8564] with the help of players [https://www.roblox.com/users/27560051/profile jay4444444444], [https://www.roblox.com/users/24707128/profile dalencylo], [https://www.roblox.com/users/41429575/profile sheat1], and [https://www.roblox.com/users/47162616/profile meblock12].\
*EvilPleeber119 screwed up and rereleased the '''Skeletal Ghostealis''' into the Build Menu when trying to disable the Borealis, when it became an Advanced Ship. It sold for about 600,000 credits.\
*The entire ship has transparency, like the [[Ghoul Nyx]] and the [[Discordite Cluster]].\

The '''''Azreal '''''is a powerful [[:Category:Dreadnought|'''Dreadnought''']] that was part of the [[Halloween Event 2019]].\
\
==Description==\
The '''Azreal ''' is a mid-range turret-focused variant of the [[Abaddon]].\
\
This ship excels at providing firepower support in fleets against capital ships and [[Galaxy Terminology|Diving]] Ships with it's extremely high firepower.\
==Appearance==\
The Azreal is a very futuristic and slim [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreadnought]] with many fins jutting out of the ship, similar to the [[Abaddon]]. At the front are its 6 Spinal Barrels which gives off an effect. The Ship's design somewhat resembles an aquatic creature.\
\
The '''Azreal''' shares the same interior as the [[Abaddon]] and [[Lucifer]], with a black, foggy hallway. At the front, there is a yellow glowing orb with electricity coming out of it, and in front of it there is yellow text that says <span style=\"color:#50e1f8\">''\"'''''SANCTION AZREAL ONLINE'''''\"''</span>.\
[[File:HalloweenAmbienceII.mp4|thumb|Ambience of the Azreal|none]]\
==Advantages==\
*Extremely high firepower for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
*Has a thin structure making it rather difficult to hit with weapons when facing towards an opponent.\
*Fantastic for PvP against other Capital ships due to its firepower.\
*Good maneuverability for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] with a turn speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turn_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Azreal'}}.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Must be facing towards the target to use all weapons.\
*Azreal's [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] have poor arcs and they can be difficult to get used to.\
*Large [[Galaxy Terminology|Blindspots]] underneath and on the back of the ship.\
*Extremely expensive for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], having high Material Costs and costing a Class B [[Permits|Permit]].\
*The extremely loud ambient noises can be heard from almost all across the map.\
==Strategies==\
* Try not to engage small [[Ships]], as your Turrets are not accurate enough to hit them.\
* Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.\
* It is very good at brawling other Capital ships, with strong [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower and high turnspeed.\
* It cannot support itself well without a fleet, so try staying in a fleet.\
* Avoid swarms of small, agile ships; your turrets aren't accurate enough to hit and destroy them, on top of your size and maneuverability making easy for the swarms to stay in your blind-spots. Bring support ships if possible to protect yourself.\
==Version History==\
*DPS lowered by 40% in version .66b\
*3 [[Spinals|Large Cannons]] and 3 [[Spinals|Large Phasers]] changed to huge variants in version .69a2.\
*1 [[Turrets|Azreal Dagger]] changed to 1 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannon]] in version .71b.\
*Hulled buffed by 1 and [[Turrets|turret]] loadout changed in version .72c20.\
* Turret loadout changed from 2 Azreal's Daggers, 3 Azreal Lasers, 4 Azreal Cannons to 1 Azreal's Dagger, 4 Azreal Cannons, 2 Azreal Lasers, 2 Azreal's Blades in version .72d.\
*Spinal count increased from 3/3 to 5/5 in version .73a.\
*Explosion Size 300 ----> 910 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*Azreal is based off the angel of death, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azrael Azrael], but the ship name is a misspelling of the mythological entity its based on.\
*The first person to lose an '''Azreal''' was [https://www.roblox.com/users/24069388/profile Edgar_Zone] to [https://www.roblox.com/users/27560051/profile jay4444444444's] [[Abaddon]].\
*The ship is blue, but it has an orange spinal focused counterpart, the [[Abaddon]].\
*Before the nerf when it was first released., it was able to solo and defeat [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]].\
*One of the many [[Ships]] with an ambience.\
*There is a recoloured, NPC version of this ship made for the 2020 Halloween event, the [[Aliens|Alien]] [[Rift Guardian]] and [[Rift Custodian|Custodian]].\
*Both the ambience of Azreal and [[Abaddon]] can be heard 200k studs away.\

}}\
==Description==\
The '''Archeon''' is a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] that specializes in destroying the [[Hull]] of large, slow targets such as enemy Planets and [[Starbase|Starbases.]] It can be very slow and is unable to defend itself from small [[ships]], especially ones that can outmaneuver its [[Turrets|Railgun]] volleys.\
==Interior==\
The interior of the Archeon consists of a small but detailed box with 4 chairs on the side, and a recliner at the front that serves as a pilot seat. \
==Advantages==\
* Good health for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]], especially in hull.\
*Performs very well in fleets.\
*Decent turn speed.\
*No [[Spinals|Spinal]] work involved, making it fairly easy to use.\
*Good hull damage.\
*Decent at chasing down hulled [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]] thanks to the vast array of kinetic weaponry.\
*Has one of the highest overall alpha damage statistics of all [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships.]]\
==Disadvantages==\
*Vulnerable when alone, it is unable to defend itself from most [[Ships]].\
*Usually cannot perform well in [[Ships|ship]] to [[Ships|ship]] combat scenarios.\
*[[Turrets|Railguns]] will almost always miss on anything smaller than a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] unless you get really close.\
*Rather low [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
*Large blindspot behind the ship.\
*[[Shields|Shield]] health is rather lacking when compared to [[Hull]] health.\
*Very poor overall damage output; being the second lowest among all [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
*Practically useless for [[Sieging]] due to the very poor damage output; even though the turret firepower looks good on paper, it cannot outrange [[Starbase]]s so it falls short against even some [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]] for effectiveness in sieges.\
==Strategy==\
* A useful tip with the '''Archeon''' is to approach it at a 45-degree angle from below the base. This will allow you to usually fire upon the base, destroying most of its [[Hull]] quickly, without taking damage yourself. Caution is advised when using this tactic, as it does not always work. Again, it is best used if you have a fleet with you in the same location.\
*The '''Archeon''' is a vulnerable ship and can easily be destroyed on its own, hence there should always be an escort. Only take it out during sieges and play smart. Don't let yourself become a target.\
*It is best used in fleets, as it is very vulnerable when alone, due to the poor accuracy of [[Turrets|Railguns]]. It should typically not be used to fight other [[ships]], as its [[Turrets|Railguns]] will have a hard time getting through [[Shields]], and their low accuracy makes PvP against small [[Ships]] nearly impossible.\
*Having such a high [[Hull]] damage output it is great for finishing off [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], both to help or counter a siege.\
*When paired with a [[Shields|Shield]] breaker, you can decimate anything large and slow.\
*Try to stay close to [[Ships]] like the [[Ampharos]], since they can get rid of small [[Ships]] for you.\
==Version History ==\
*Received a remodel in .61g. The older model is seen below.\
*Medium Laser replaced with Heavy Railgun in version .65b.\
*Received a remodel in version .66m.\
*Turn Speed reduced from 0.4 to 0.3, Turret Loadout changed from 6 Medium Railguns, 1 Heavy LR Laser, and 1 Heavy Railgun to 4 Medium Railguns, 1 Medium Siege Railgun, 2 Heavy LR Lasers, and 2 Heavy Railguns in version .74b14(?).\
*Explosion size 45 ----> 270 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*The '''Archeon''' is similar in design to the [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]] [[Argosy]], from its appearance to [[Hull]]-destroyer.\
*Some people call this a \"Mini-[[Ridgebreaker]]\" because both have bad [[Turrets|Turret]] placement and are [[Hull]] destroyers and siege ships.\
*The '''Archeon''' has \"Acheion\" spelled on Its upper right engine in Japanese, which is \"'''Archeon'''\" mistranslated.[[File:Th (1).jpg|thumb|220x220px|Second remodel.]][[File:Archeon changed.png|thumb|220x220px|The Archeon before it was remodeled|none]]\
*The '''Archeon''' originally had a [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]] on the front in Alpha.\
*Has similar features to the [[Argosy]].[[File:Archeon.png|thumb|224x224px|Archeon from Alpha|none]]\

The '''''Catalyst''''' is a large Support-PvP [[:Category:Dreadnought|'''Dreadnought''']].\
==Description==\
The '''Catalyst''' is a durable dreadnought with decent weaponry, capable of being a versatile support ship in all situations except against swarms or when fighting small and fast ships. The balanced health pool of 16,000 HP allows it to tank in [[Sieging|sieges]] against a variety of bases, while the heavy-medium armament (being something like an opposite counterpart to the armament seen on the [[Apocalypse]] in terms of damage output) allows it to perform a support role well in PvP combat against other [[:Category:Capital Ship|capital ships]]. However, there are a couple major downsides. One being that the '''Catalyst''' by comparison to other dreadnoughts, has mediocre damage output. The other, is that the ship suffers from sluggish maneuverability; which combined with the relatively poor accuracy on the armament makes it prone to being swarmed, or even harassed by fast [[:Category:Battleship|battleships]].\
==Appearance==\
The ship is mostly light grey in colour, with some black and neon blue spots here and there. It carries a roughly rectangular array of thrusters in the rear and tapers out to a point in the front, with the ship gradually stepping down in thickness. The turret array reflects this pattern, with the larger capital turrets being set back along the sides of the ship and the medium cannons being lined up along the front and top. The interior is a large white room with red lining. The pilot seat is in the middle of this room, along with three white screens.\
==Advantages==\
* Highest health pool out of any Non-Limited dreadnought, having 16,000 Total HP, higher than the [[Judgement]]'s 15,000 total HP.\
* Slightly above average maneuverability for a Dreadnought.\
* Can do okay damage to both [[Shields]] and [[Hull]] at a close range.\
* Can do decently in PvP against many [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
* Can do decent Hull damage at a long range.\
*Good LoS which covers most of the ship and allows the pilot to fire all turrets facing slightly downwards.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Overall rather mediocre DPS, worse than several build menu [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
* Heavy Turrets have poor accuracy, making this ship easy prey for swarms of smaller, faster [[Ships]].\
* 8th most expensive Dreadnought on the build menu.\
* Struggles to PvP most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], even most [[:Category:Siege Ship|Siege Ships]] of the same class outperform the Catalyst.\
* Will often struggle to PvP [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] alone due to the slow turn speed.\
==Strategy==\
* Try to stay under your opponent so all Turrets have a line of sight.\
* Can do long-range support in a siege thanks to its Dual Heavy Railgun and Capital Triple Cannons, but it is not recommended to try to do long-range sieging as you will do abysmal damage without your closer range turrets.\
* Don't attempt to fight maneuverable or agile ships(including many Battleships) without support, as they can easily get and stay in your blind-spots due to the poor turn speed and size of the ship.\
* If necessary, you can be the tank due to your VERY large health pool. But, do not engage in ship-ship combat, as you will most likely be shredded without doing much damage. \
==Version History==\
* Shield/Hull changed from 5750/6750 to 6580/6520, armament buffed, remodelled in version .66b.\
* Shield changed from 6580 to 6540 and its total cost dropped from 202k to 163k in version .66c.\
* 2 Capital Triple Cannons changed to 2 Triple Heavy Lasers and 1 Triple Heavy Cannon changed to 1 Medium Railgun in version .69a1.\
* 2 Capital Lasers changed to 2 Capital Triple Cannons, 2 Triple Heavy Lasers changed to 2 Dual Medium Lasers and 1 Triple Heavy Cannon changed to 1 Dual Medium Cannon in version .69a1.\
*Shield increased from 6540 to 7000 in version .70a8.\
*Explosion Size 140 ----> 680 .75a12\
*Shield and hull increased from 7000/6520 to 8000/8000 in an unknown version.  \
==Trivia==\
* This ship was heavily used by multiboxer Supreme4Ever because of the extreme ease of use and health.\
*The original model was similar to the Hiigaran Destroyer from Homeworld.\
*2nd Dreadnought to be on the Weekly Discount rotation\

==Description==\
The '''Warlock''' is a long ship, with [[Turrets|Lasers]] and [[Turrets|Railgun Turrets]] grouped together along the sides of the ship's body. This ship is well known for the ring surrounding its engines, which can be seen near the back of this latest remodel.\
\
The '''Warlock''' can be used as a support siege ship since it has an array of balanced [[Turrets]] and great health.\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Warlock''' is the exact same as the interior of the [[Witch]]. There is a small teleporter pad that leads to a hallway stretching nearly the entire length of the ship. The hallway has three wider openings with a set of three windows on each side of the openings. The middle opening contains one large pilot's seat and a faction-colored neon screen.\
==Advantages==\
*Decent turret firepower with its 5 [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]] and 3 Heavy Turrets.\
* Decent range allows it to dish out full damage while staying behind a tank during PVP and sieges.\
*Decent health for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* Great fleet support due to its versatility.\
* Performs surprisingly well as a [[Pirating|Pirate]] ship due to the balanced damage the [[Turrets|Railguns]] and [[Turrets|Lasers]] can deal.\
*Great maneuverability.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Vulnerable backside and only 1 turret on the bottom.\
*Lacks [[Turrets|Small Turrets]], lowering its effectiveness against small [[Ships]].\
*Jack of all trades; master of none. Can't deal very well with being outgunned.\
* Rather mediocre damage output, it is on par with the [[Prowler]].\
== Strategy==\
*Pick your fights. You won't last very long in direct combat with bigger ships.\
*Attack from below to ensure that all your [[Turrets]] hit.\
*Try to move slowly behind [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] during a siege, let them tank, while you use your firepower.\
*When attacking larger and slower ships, always stay underneath them or in a blind-spot using the Warlock's speed.\
==Version History==\

==Trivia==\
{{Picture Infobox Mk II|title1 = Warlock Models|image = }}\
*When Galaxy was in Alpha, the '''Warlock''' originally had a mixed load-out, all the [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]] could be a [[Turrets|Railgun]] or [[Turrets|Laser]], however, then in beta, the '''Warlock''' lost this ability. After beta the '''Warlock''' got it back due to a glitch then it was quickly fixed and it was removed again.\
*The interior of the ship used to be just a long hallway to the pilot seat.\
*Has a more pvp focused counterpart, the [[Witch]].\
*The newest '''Warlock''' remodel looks exactly like the [[Witch]]. In fact, the interiors of the newest remodels are exactly the same.\
* The '''Warlock''' has a light blue trail behind it.\
*A very popular battleship amongst players.\
*An Older model of the '''Warlock''' is featured in the teaser image on the Roblox game page along with the [[Archangel]] and the [[Spectre]] of its time.\
*One of the 2 first ships with 10 turrets along with the [[Tempest]].\

== Description ==\
<nowiki/>The Retribution is a generic PvP [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] that bears a close resemblance to the old [[Armageddon]] model. It is modeled after the Cobra Class Destroyer from Warhammer 40k. It has good turret firepower and spinals but lacks defense against smaller ships.\
\
\
== Appearance ==\
There is a small teleporter located on the back of the ship, which sends you to a simple room with white floors and walls. The pilot seat is a short walk ahead. (just like the catalyst)\
== Advantages ==\
* Very cheap compared to some Dreadnoughts.\
* Decent [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower against [[Hull]] of other [[Ships]].\
* Incredibly versatile, able to solo [[Sieging|siege]] an undefended level 2 [[Starbase]] if used correctly.\
* [[Spinals]] have a high Rate of Fire, allowing multiple chances to hit an enemy in a short period of time.\
* Can cripple Hulled [[Ships]] if used correctly.\
* Spinals can deal good hull damage.\
*Wide variety of turrets, though not all of them can be used at once, lowering the DPS of the ship.\
*Slightly above average tank.\
== Disadvantages. ==\
*Limited ability to fend off smaller [[Ships]] after the dreadnought re-balance converted its medium turrets to large ones.\
*Mediocre movement speed requires expert maneuvering from the pilot in PvP situations.\
*Unable to fire all turrets at once due to poor turret placement; there will always be at least two turrets unable to fire from any angle(with the exception of broadsiding[where only one turret is unable to fire], which renders your spinals unusable).\
*Slow maneuverability makes it difficult to give the turrets a line of sight and aim the spinals.\
*Large and easy to hit.\
*\
== Strategy ==\
* As much as it is a fierce [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], the '''Retribution''' is at its best when in a fleet.\
*When in a 1v1 situation, use your mobility to your advantage. Attack from your target's blind spot.\
*Make sure to approach from below your target, and only go head on if the target is a small [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] or [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] such as the [[Sentaliz]] or [[Vigilance]].\
*Never tank for prolonged periods of time in a [[Sieging|Siege]].\
*Make sure to be ready to pull out in case the tide turns in your enemy's favor.\
*When [[Sieging]] in a fleet, park your ship at [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]] range (7000 studs away) and use your Heavy Lasers along with your [[Spinal Weaponry|Small Torpedoes]] to attack the base, while not tanking too much damage.\
*During sieges, your goal is to support core capital [[Ships]]. Be sure to fend off any defenders. Focus on enemy [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]; they can cause serious problems during a siege.\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled in an unknown version.\
* Got a second remodel in version .66b, though it was met by much criticism from players and later reverted and the model was reused as a [[Loyalist]] remodel.\
* Remodeled and price lowered in version .67c.\
* 1 [[Turrets|Capital Triple Laser]] changed to 1 [[Turrets|Capital Triple Cannon]], 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]], 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Lasers]] and given 1 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Laser]] in version .69a1.\
* 6 [[Turrets|Medium Cannons]] changed to 4 [[Turrets|Small Torpedoes]] and Turn Speed increased from 0.13 to 0.17 in version .69a1.\
*Teleporter fixed .75a12\
*Explosion Size 140 ----> 660 .75a12\
*Turnspeed 0.17 ----> 0.22 .75a20\
== Trivia ==\
*Based on the Cobra Class Destroyer from Warhammer 40K.\
*When you walk into the cockpit, you'll see the words \"'''''I am the holy executioner of the heretic'''''\" above the window.\
*Was stripped of any exterior design which most players protested and let to it being rarely used until the current model was added.\
*A very detailed exterior just like the [[Armageddon]].{{Image_Infobox|title1 = Reverted Remodel|image = retributionremodel.png|title3 = Original Retribution Model|image3 = Retribution updated.png}}__NOTOC__\

==Description==\
The '''Black Flare''' is a fast and maneuverable [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] that relies on its small [[Turrets]] to penetrate [[Shields|Shield]] and its [[Turrets|Railguns]] to deal heavy [[Hull]] damage. The '''Black Flare''' has a decent health pool and a slim body, making it great at sustaining battle against inaccurate opponents.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior contains a hallway about half the length of the ship. There are seats and decorative screens along the sides, and two \"cargo holds\" sticking out on either side of the hall. The pilot's seat is located at the end of the hall, next to some glass on the floor.\
== Advantages ==\
* Extremely high mobility, higher than some [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]] or even a few [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyers]].\
* High health.\
* High firepower, can dish out high hull damage and equally as much shield damage.\
* Good all-rounder.\
* Decent Spinals.\
* No weak spots.\
* One of the fastest [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] in the game.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* When fighting [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] or above, you stand little chance.\
* Requires you to face your opponent straight-on in order to have all your [[Turrets]] be able to fire and use [[Spinals]].\
*Requires Spinal aiming to deal significant Shield damage.\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship is best used to support a [[Sieging|Siege]] fleet.\
* It's light Lasers help fend off smaller ships, and its [[Spinals]] add even more shield breaking power.\
* When attacking a smaller vessel such as a [[Cobra]] or [[Sixfold]], get as close as you can so most of your [[Turrets]] hit. The Railguns are vital once their Shield runs out so slanting forward slightly will help ensure more hits.\
* Use the Spinals. Usually, only two of the mall Lasers can hit and the Railguns do low damage to [[Shields]]. The spinal Phasers will help ensure a better chance of victory.\
* Use the railguns to attack from afar and to support a siege fleet.\
* The high turn speed allows the '''Black Flare''' to quickly turn upside down to fire at enemies underneath.\
* The Top Speed for its size allows the '''Black Flare '''to kite other ships of its class.\
* Use your speed and maneuverability to avoid enemy fire while firing with your [[Spinals]], then finish them with your [[Turrets|Railguns]].\
* Use this in swarms for amazing combined damage.\
*You can attack a [[Ships|Ship]] with a large blindspot by taking advantage of your high mobility. \
== Version History ==\
* The '''Black Flare''' received a remodel in the .55 range due to its main model being uneditable.\
* The ship was reverted to an optimized version of its previous model in .61g due to the current model having a high part count.\
* Its docking was fixed by adding a long translucent part extending out from the door. (Unknown Version)\
* Railgun count decreased from 3 to 2 in version .73b3\
== Trivia ==\
* During the Alpha phases of the game, the '''Black Flare''' originally had an engine room which ended up being removed due to part count and lag. During this time the '''Black Flare''' was infamously known as the \"Lag Flare.\"\
* The '''Black flare's''' second model was actually intended to be an independent ship, but was made into the second '''Black Flare'''. [https://www.roblox.com/library/397852309/Galaxy-Artemis '''Black Flare''' remodel]\
* People often compare this ship to the [[Razor Wing]].\
* It has a highly detailed interior.\
* Although is has a detailed interior, it is difficult to see inside it, as the inside is very dark and all the walls are black.\
* It is currently the only battlecruiser with railguns.\
* There is a remodeled '''Black Flare''' for admins known as the [[Golden Flare]].\
* Docking has been changed in a recent update from the main entrance, to the front of the ship, making it easier for players to board it (if not leave it also).\
* Has a very detailed but somewhat ugly exterior. [[File:BLACK FLARE3.png|thumb|220x220px|Old Black Flare Model|left]][[File:Black Flare Interior.png|thumb|348x348px|Black Flare's Interior]]\

}}\
==Description==\
The '''''Nautilus''''' is an unexpected and powerful event ship added on April 5th, 2020. It is armed with its own unique Turrets called Enclaves, which float above and below their mounts on the ship.\
\
This [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] excels at being a good support ship for Fleets, [[Sieging]]. and [[Galaxy Slang|Diving]], with balanced [[Hull]] and [[Shields|Shield]] for tanking, powerful  Laser [[Turrets]] for shredding [[Shields]], and having long range cannons for [[Sieging]].\
\
==Appearance==\
The Nautilus is small, flat [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] that has an organic, aquatic look, has design traits with similar to the [[Zillavik]] and has 4 Triangle-shaped turrets orbiting it.\
\
The '''Interior''' starts with a cylinder shaped teleporter, which leads into a small room. The small room contains a seat and a circular computer and screen in front, with similar coloring to the outside.\
==Advantages==\
*[[Galaxy Slang|Balanced]] DPS, a combination of [[Spinals|Spinal]] Cannons and high damage Laser [[Turrets]].\
*[[Galaxy Slang|Balanced]] Health.\
*Has high total health compared to other [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
*Has little to no [[Galaxy Slang|blind-spots]].\
*Great mobility for a Battleship at 0.57 Turn-speed.\
*Easily shreds most [[Build Menu|BM]] Battleships and can take on some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] if the pilot is skilled enough.\
==Disadvantages== \
*Extremely expensive for a Battleship, costing 500,000+ credits if every material is bought from the [[Mega Base]]. This makes it as expensive as a [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Slow acceleration.\
*High warehouse level for a Battleship (most players experienced enough to afford this ship will already have enough space however).\
*Inaccurate Turrets struggle to hit anything smaller than a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
* Requires good spinal aim for effective hull damage.\
*The quest to obtain its blueprint is a one-time deal, making it Limited.\
\
==Strategy ==\
* Be careful when using this ship, especially during war, as it costs more than most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*Use the turrets to shred the shield of an opponent, and then focus on spinals once the target is [[Galaxy Slang|Hulled]].\
*Only use it when you do not have Battleship loyalty or need a more maneuverable ship, since most Dreadnoughts and even high DPS Battleships like the [[Panther]] can be more effective.\
*Use your cannons to easily finish off [[Galaxy Slang|Hulled]] targets or steal kills.\
==Version History==\
* Taken offsale in an unknown version.\
*Both spinals received an additional Large Cannon (for a total of 3 Large Cannons per spinal) in version .72e1\
*Quest reactivated, price changed from 10,000 Uranium, 1 Alien Device, and 50,000 credits to 3,000 Uranium, 5,000 Alien Parts, 75 Plasma Batteries, and 40,000 credits in version .72e1\
* Quest requirements slightly changed from 5,000 Alien Parts to one Alien Device, and 75 Plasma Batteries to 65 Plasma Batteries in version .72e1\
*Re-enabled as a build menu ship in version .73c10, but now with additional material requirements, including a [[Nautilus Blueprint]].\
*Model archived by ap_ek, causing ship to be invisible in an unknown version.\
*Ship no longer invisible due to a remodel made by robloxgold14 and Biokari .75a12\
*Advanced Enclaves remodel by consumer of robloxgold14 .75a12\
*Explosion size 60 ----> 450 in .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*Added as a \"secret\" that requires a quest to build.\
*Previously considered not worth it due to high price and limited combat capabilities.\
*Can capture [[Myriad III]] in around 3 minutes.\
*The quest giver for the '''Nautilus ''' was previously found on a wreck 66k studs north of the [[Mega Base]].\
*The top Enclaves are larger than the bottom Enclaves.\
*On 6/25/20 many [[Materials|Alien Parts]] were deposited into the Mega Base, resulting in the construction of many '''Nautiluses.''' \
*The location of the Nautilus Blueprint quest is at [[Nautilus Blueprint|Freedom Base]], and the Thrust Components can be manufactured at the [[Thrust Component|Leviathan]] wreck.\

==Description==\
The '''Loyalist''' is a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] equipped entirely with [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]] and a few spinals. This [[Ships|ship]] can be used much like the [[Ampharos]] or [[Tempest]], as its [[Turrets]] have a high rate of fire with decent accuracy. It is almost entirely black with the team colors most visible on the engines and between the plated areas. The ship is also great for AA (Anti Aircraft)\
==Interior==\
The interior consists of a lit hallway with a seat and holograms in front of it and a teleporter to the outside in the back.\
[[File:Loyalist Interior.png|thumb]]\
==Advantages==\
*High health for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*It's eight high-accuracy [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]] provide high damage at close range against both small and large ships.\
*[[Turrets]] are all on top, allowing quick focus fire on one ship.\
*Has two large cannons for finishing off targets.\
*Incredible AA defense.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Highly vulnerable bottom.\
*Weak [[Spinals]].\
*Very large and easy to hit, being larger than some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
* Turrets have low range.\
*The [[Ampharos]] is better in multiple aspects such as speed, cost, size, and turrets.\
*Not very maneuverable.\
*Almost useless against anything of its size or larger.\
==Strategy ==\
*Provide excellent anti-ship support to a siege fleet, especially against [[Ships]] around the size of [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]].\
*Stay behind other ships when larger ships attack. The [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]] are best used for support and are not always effective against large targets with high health, even at this quantity.\
*Since this ship is incredible good at small ship destruction, use this ship against anything battlecruiser or lower.\
*Since the blindspot below you can be exploited a lot, try to mostly outmaneuver your opponents with repeated descending warps. If you think you can't keep your target in sight for the weapons, do not force the fight and flee to your closest starbase.\
*This ship excels at [[Aliens|Alien]] hunting. While it can't fight a [[Punisher]] in a 1v1, it can destroy most of the [[Swarmer]]s, [[Outrider]]s and [[Kneall Bruiser|Bruiser]]s with ease.\
==Version History==\
*Received a shield and hull buff and it's [[Turrets]] were changed from 8 [[Turrets|Gatling Turrets]] to 8 [[Turrets|Medium Turrets]] in version .63h. Likely due to the fact that when there was heavy server lag, the [[Turrets|Gatling]] fire rate would become dramatically slower, which hindered the '''Loyalist''' from dealing its full DPS.\
*2 [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Lasers]] and 2 [[Turrets|Medium Cannons]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Medium Railguns]] in version .65a6 along with the new [[Turrets|Turret]] models.\
*Turret loadout changed from 2 Medium Lasers, 2 Dual Medium Lasers, 2 Medium Railguns, 2 Dual Medium Cannons to 2 point defense lasers, max [[Hull]] increased from 3200 to 3600 in version .66b.\
*Buffed in .66b, increasing its shield from 3850 to 4050 and its hull from 3600 to 3650.\
*Nerfed in .69a1, decreasing its hull from 3650 to 2500.\
* 2 Medium Flak Cannons moved to the bottom of the ship in version .69e.\
*Turn speed buffed from 0.1 to 0.35 in version .70c\
*Explosion size 30 ----> 260 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
* The ship was originally going to be called the Cyclone but was changed for unknown reasons.\
*The ship used to \"hard-counter\" small ships but after the re-balance, it was near useless against them, a grim irony taking the description into account.\
*It was considered one of the worst [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] before the re-balance like the [[Sovereign]]. But became one of the best afterward. \
\
*The current model used to belong to the [[Retribution]], however the model was given to the Loyalist after constant complaints.\
*The description was incorrect during the time of update .63h considering it was armed with more PVP-oriented weapons.\

== Description ==\
The '''Necromancer''' is the latest iteration of Halloween event bosses. Reports from players suggest that it is equivalent to a Prototype (such as the [[Kneall Prototype]]), which is supported by its Super-Capital Class map icon. It has a much higher turn speed than player [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]], making exploiting its blindspots more difficult.\
==Spawn Conditions==\
The '''Necromancer''' will be capable of spawning when a server has at least 6 players, and the round time passes 60 minutes.\
== Armament ==\
The '''Necromancer''' is armed with ???\
== Strategy ==\
The '''Necromancer''' has a small blindspot below the ship, but none behind, above, to the sides or in front. The one blindspot it does have is nearly impossible to exploit for more than a few seconds due to the incredibly high turn speed, and attempting to stay in this blindspot is very dangerous for all ships, regardless of speed and size..\
\
Unlike previous bosses, distractions with small, fast ships like the [[Viper]] and [[Draco]] are almost useless as it tends to ignore any potential distractions, instead focusing on larger more valuable ships and bases which pose bigger threats. More powerful [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], or bases and planets, are required to both tank the high damage as well as deal enough damage to destroy it. It is vital that there are other ships to kill the scourges and serv's. If you don't have a large enough fleet and your base isn't max it will most likely die if you don't have any battleships, dreads or maybe even a carrier if you can coordinate your team and have them use the fighters. A good strategy when baiting it to your base is have a speed tank like a viper and hit the scourges with it or the necro and they will focus you sometimes the necro will be locked on to the base and you cannot get it to focus you but if the other aliens focus you, you have a high chance of success. When I did it with a lvl 5 starbase and a couple sips it got my base to 3k hull and when it had shield it was losing 1k shield every 2 seconds from necro so BEWARE.\
* The necromancer has a similar explosion radius to the prototype (20k range). The explosion takes out every nearby alien ship, making for safer looting afterward. Try not to use planets to kill the necromancer, because if the planet is on low enough health when the necromancer dies, the explosion damage will assimilate said planet into the alien team.\
* A good strategy is to upgrade a base to its max (Preferably a [[Starbase]] or the [[Mothership]]) and then wait for the necromancer to warp to it or lure it to it. While the base is doing high damage on the Necromancer and the other aliens use a large and tanky ship to soak damage while both you and the base/planet deal as much damage as possible. If you do not have a fleet to support you, it is best to kill as many Servs and Scourges as possible before engaging the Necromancer to minimize damage taken.\
* Another option with the [[Mothership]] is to let the Necromancer destroy the base and the explosion of the [[Mothership]] will take out the Necromancer as well as the other ships around it including other aliens and any other player ships that don't warp out in time. This only works if a player ship remains to keep the Necromancer's attention while the [[Mothership]] is exploding. If the Necromancer has nothing else to attack after it has killed the [[Mothership]], it will warp away and survive the explosion.\
== Loot ==\
*<s>? Ores.\
*300 [[Gamma Pumpkin]]s.\
*700k worth of loot used to be 3 million, then nerfed to 1.5 million, then after gamma pumpkin nerf, it went down to about 700k.</s>\
* Currently appears to be broken. 1111 Silicate, 731 Carbon, 568 Iridium, 77 Adamantite, 110 Palladium, 87 Titanium, 87 Quantium, 23 Uranium, and 0 pumpkins. This data was gathered from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GIIp3X_nlA this video].\
== Version History ==\
* Gamma pumpkin drop rate nerfed in version .69b1 (? -> ?)\
* AI updated in version .69b1—should no longer go out of bounds, should no longer attack safe dock ships, should no longer be distracted by player ships.\
* Health and DPS reduced, loot increased in version .69b1.\
==Trivia==\
* Commonly mistaken for just being a neon ring, the Necromancer has a ring made up of Kneall writing that seems to translate to \"Hollowborn.\"\
* This ship was once on sale in the Build Menu during Part 2, costing 220,259 Silicate, 195,131 Iridium, 189,268 Carbon, 90,148 Adamantite, 95,840 Palladium, 91,800 Titanium, 88,128 Quantium, and 39,658 Uranium. The manufacturing fee was 819,269 credits.\

== Description ==\
The '''MLRS '''is a [[Spinals|Torpedo]] focused [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]]. It was released on December 20th, 2018; when the [[Christmas Event 2018]] started.\
== Appearance ==\
{{Outdated section}}\
The '''MLRS''' has 2 large torpedo launchers on its back and is larger than most [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]].\
\
The Interior is a large glass dome in the middle of the ship with a seat and 3 screens positioned in front of the seat.\
==Advantages== \
*Great amount of health for a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
*Powerful [[Spinals]].\
*Has [[Spinals|Medium Torpedoes]] which can be used to siege [[Starbase]]s and large [[Ships]] from afar.\
* Very good at PvP if the pilot is skilled with [[Spinals]].\
* Its [[Spinals|Medium Torpedoes]] outrange [[Starbase]]s massively, and thus it can solo siege a [[Starbase]] if it is undefended.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Very vulnerable to fast, small ships as it will have a hard time hitting its [[Spinals]] and has very low [[Turrets|turret]] firepower.\
*[[Spinals]] reload slowly, and have an undesirable firing interval of 1.2 seconds if you're trying to [[Strategies#Pirating|Pirate]] other ships.\
* Very expensive for its class.\
* The slowest [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]], slower than some [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
*Vulnerable bottom.\
*Large size for its class.\
*Low maneuverability.\
==Strategy==\
*Use its [[Spinals|Medium Torpedoes]] to heavily damage large and sluggish ships from a distance.\
*Stay in the back of the fleet and kill any small [[Ships]] that come your way, while attacking larger targets with your [[Spinals]].\
*Use your [[Spinals|Torpedoes]] to attack larger, slower moving ships such as slow-moving [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], as smaller [[ships]] can evade your [[Spinals|Torpedoes]].\
*Go near targets for more accurate Torpedo hits.\
*Stay out of the range of [[Starbase]] turrets and use the small turrets to get rid of any fighters or small ships coming your way during sieges.\
*If you get targeted, you will usually be destroyed. Try to stay behind more expensive ships and don't attack directly.\
==Version History==\
*Added in .65b.\
* Small Torpedoes buffed to Medium Torpedoes in version .65b.\
* 2 Medium Torpedoes changed to 4 Small Torpedoes, dark blue color changed to use team colors in version .71c.\
*Renamed from MRLS Launcher to MLRS in an unknown version.\
* Shield decreased from 2500 to 2000, Hull decreased from 2000 to 1000, 6 Small Torpedoes changed to 6 Medium Torpedoes with a 1.5s (says 1.6, but is also said to be 1.5; clarification required) interval, Top Speed increased from 45 to 80, Acceleration increased from 10 to 16, and Turn Speed reduced from 0.17 to 0.15 in version .75a37 '''(?)'''.\
*Ship remodeled, Medium Torpedo interval reduced from 1.5 to 1.2, and Uranium material cost increased by 300 in version .75a37 '''(?)'''.\
== Trivia==\
*Added during the [[Christmas Event 2018]].\
*There is a limited remodel of this ship, named the [[Frozen MLRS]].\
*It contains unique re-skinned missiles, however, they do the same damage as [[Spinals|Medium Torpedoes]]. Its old model used to have the same missile models used on the <span style=\"color:#8dfc80\">[[Frozen MLRS]]</span>.\
*Even though the MRLS Launcher has 6 torpedoes, it used to only fire 2 of them on its old model a long time ago.\
*The old model's back engines had a look similar to the [[Prototype X-2]]'s engines.\
*A variant of the MRLS Launcher was released for free in the battlecruiser menu on March 31st for the [[April Fool's Event 2022]]. It was called the [[MRLS Launcher Launcher]] (later renamed [[MLMLRS]]). It had 251 small torpedoes and 4 Large torpedoes that did tremendous amounts of damage. It was 3 times bigger than a MRLS Launcher and had the same model. The torpedoes are small white MRLS Launchers. During that time, people used it as a mega cool troll ship. It was later stripped of its 251 small torpedoes as they were incredibly overpowered for their class.\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''SR-71''' is a [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ship]] heavily armed with [[Spinal Weaponry|Medium Torpedoes]], and possesses incredible maneuverability. \
\
This ship excels at [[Galaxy Slang|diving]] Ships with it's high alpha and long range, as well as being excellent in [[Sieging]] for the same reasons. This ship can easily escape any dangerous situation with it's speed and stealth, with it being invisible on the [[Minimap]].\
== Appearance ==\
'''''Note that the true color of the SR-71 is not what is depicted at the images and is just the background color of the planet [[Myriad III]]. The SR-71 is fully transparent as shown in the trails picture.''' \
\
The SR-71 looks largely similar to its real-life counterpart, the SR-71 \"Blackbird,\" with a thin, tapered fighter jet-like frame, with an antenna on the tip of the nose. Two large turbines are integrated into its wings, with vertical stabilizers rising from the end of each engine. The front of the turbines are capped by inlet spikes, while the rear emits a trail effect, somewhat negating this ship's stealthiness. \
\
The Interior has a small cockpit where the player sits, with two small pilots' seats and a graphic showing an \"ICEE\" polar bear and a poorly-drawn rubber duck wearing a tophat, button-down shirt, and bowtie.\
== Advantages ==\
*The holy grail of spinal firepower compared to all other ships of its class; It packs a serious punch.\
*Very high [[hull]] damage output with the Medium Torpedoes on top of a 10,000 stud range.\
*Incredible maneuverability allows it to be capable of evading even point defense turrets, and can make it difficult to hit the ship with spinals.\
*Extremely High [[Galaxy Slang|alpha damage]] makes it incredible for stealing kills from crippled ships.\
*Excellent for sieging starbases of any level, assuming that it's not being protected.\
== Disadvantages ==\
*Lowest health out of all [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreadnoughts]].\
*Mediocre [[Shields|shield]] damage output compared to [[hull]] damage output.\
*Medium Torpedoes are somewhat slow, which can make it difficult to lead moving targets.\
*Poor spinal firing arcs caused by the Torpedoes being far apart from the center.\
*[[:Category:Limited|Limited]] classification, high price, and somewhat large frame make it a prime target.\
*Vulnerable to swarming due to complete lack of point defense armament and non-ideal spinal placement.\
== Strategy ==\
*Even with your incredibly high speed, be wary of ships like the [[Zeus]], [[Tempest]], [[Loyalist]], and [[Ampharos]] that are equipped with a heavy armament of point-defense turrets with the accuracy to do significant damage if you get too close to them.\
*Extremely effective in [[Sieging|Sieges]] as all of its weapons can out-range [[Starbase]]s and the ship can dodge most incoming firepower even at a close distance.\
*Do not use this alone. However, if you do; take advantage of your stealth as much as possible to avoid being destroyed.\
*Avoid attempting to engage small enemy ships, as the spinal placement is not suitable for that.\
*Pay attention and check the Minimap often to make sure you're not about to be ambushed. Your relatively low health means you must always avoid damage.\
*Use the high firepower on this ship to assault and chase down vulnerable or isolated [[:Category:Capital Ship|capital ships]].\
*Do not wait until the ship shields are down to start retreating, because even with your stealth and speed; being hulled can prove to be a death sentence. Whenever you must make an escape from combat however, warp far into empty space (but not near the map borders) to make your position unpredictable to any enemies that may try to chase you. Note that this strategy may not work well if there is a spy on your team.\
== Quest ==\
The SR-71 could be obtained via the [[:Category:Quest|Quest]] #20220701 [[Something Special]], during the [[Fourth of July 2022]] event.\
== Version History ==\
*Added in the [[Fourth of July 2022]] Event in version .75a12.\
*Added to LBM for a C permit .75a20\
== Trivia ==\
*Based off its real-life counterpart, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird SR-71 Blackbird].\
*Was made for the admin Rapidofast due to his love of the real life plane.\
*The first SR-71 destroyed in-game was ebal_ex's, destroyed from the explosion of IzzymichChooCHoo's [[Oblivion]].\
*In real life, the SR-71 was never armed, instead, the armed version was the variant of the SR-71: The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_YF-12 YF-12].\

As with most ROBLOX events, players could win prizes in each game by completing specific objectives.

<h1>The Galaxy Part</h1>ROBLOX's event dialogue for [https://www.roblox.com/games/200330616/Galaxy Galaxy] read as follows:\
\
\"The galaxy is a mysterious place, with hidden treasures waiting for you to discover! Luckily, you now have new, futuristic spaceports to help you on your quest. Your missions are to use them to help combat intergalactic villainy. Be warned though - the stars are a perilous battleground, and you must evade enemy ships to survive. To earn an exclusive treasure, mine the rare space mineral and sell it to a special dealer at the spaceports. If you can smuggle 3 goods through these spaceports, you’ll also get a new buddy to travel with you across the stars!\"\
\
[[File:Capture.png|centre|650x650px]]\
There were 2 objectives in [https://www.roblox.com/games/200330616/Galaxy Galaxy]. The first objective was to go to the [[Derelict Station]] and mine 20 [[Ores|Uranium Ore]], which you would subsequently deliver to the station. This would award you the [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/566778868/Galactic-Sun-Hat Galactic Sun Hat] and the \"Going Nuclear\" badge. To obtain this quest you had to talk to Billy Ray Joe, who is still located inside the [[Mega Base]]. The badge earned its name due to a feature available prior to the public release of the update: Players were able to click a button in the starbase menu inside the [[Derelict Station]] labeled '''\"DO NOT PRESS.\" ''' Activating this button would blow up the station after a few seconds.\
\
The second objective was to deliver 3 crates of medicine to the [[Freedom Base]]. To obtain this quest you had to talk to Luke Skybawler, who was also inside the [[Mega Base]]. Upon completing this, players received the [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/566779626/Interstellar-Sunglasses Interstellar Sunglasses] and the \"Help The Freedom Base\" badge. Luke Skybrawler was replaced with Luca Sky partway through the event.\
\
\
\
The [[Freedom Base]] quest involves avoiding [[Pirates]] that spawn upon accepting the quest and also spawn randomly. This makes it more of a challenge than simply delivering a few crates of medicine. Three [[Pirates]] spawn per person who accepts the quest with a maximum of 9 [[Pirates]] per server. Prior to the public release, there was no max amount of [[Pirates]], leading to swarms of [[Pirates]] able to take down an entire fleet of Dreadnoughts. The [[pirates|Pirate]] [[Osprey]] was removed to make it a bit easier for players to destroy the other ships. The [[Pirates|Pirate]] [[Starblade]] was also later removed for being too OP with backward firing torpedoes, aimbot, and ramming, leaving only the [[Pirates|Pirate]] [[Avenger]]. [[Pirates]] will attack any ships (including [[Aliens]]) that approach the Freedom base. It is recommended to kill the [[Pirates]] first before delivering the medicine. Most people that complete the quest either had support ships taking out the [[Pirates]] or tried their luck with an army of [[Wyrm]]s/traders. Many players found great entertainment in watching large \"Alien Fleets\" fight dozens of [[Pirates]]. (As of February 2018, the quest rewards have been shut down via Roblox's request; while you still can complete the 2 quests in-game, you can no longer earn the event prizes linked to the 2016 Galaxy Star Wars event.)\
\
The [[Military HQ]] was also added to Galaxy during this event. It currently serves no purpose and does not spawn in regular servers.\
\
Recently, the \"Help The [[Freedom Base]]\" Badge and \"Going Nuclear\" Badge were updated. They both have a new picture and are now called \"Complete Quest 1\" and \"Complete Quest 2\".\

==Description  ==\
The '''Patriotic Rorqual''' was released as a July 4th Event ship. There are special features that set it apart from the [[Rorqual]]. Equipped with 4 [[Turrets|Patriotic Mining Lasers]], with 6,500 stud range it makes Patriotic Rorqual overall a much more efficient miner than the normal [[Rorqual]]. The mining and money making potential is higher than the [[M Class]]. Since the '''Patriotic Rorqual''' values capitalism so much, it doesn't change to the faction color due to the power of America by its side. Takes a minimum of ~156 seconds to fill up its hold.\
==Interior ==\
The '''Patriotic Rorqual''' has an interior very similar to that of the original [[Rorqual]]. However, the left and right walls are a pure, bright blue, the back and front walls are white, and the floor is covered in dark red carpet. The pilots' seat is white and has a control panel directly in front of it, ending with the panel having colorful buttons & a picture of John F. Kennedy on the top side.\
==Advantages ==\
* High health for a Miner.\
*Faster than [[Rorqual]].\
*Large range (6500 studs).\
==Disadvantages ==\
* Slow and large, making it vulnerable coupled with the fact that it has no defenses.\
*[[Pirates]] and [[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
*[[Pirating|Pirates]] (player) are more likely to target you because of the fact that the '''Patriotic Rorqual''' is extremely rare.\
*Despite being rare and expensive, the '''Patriotic Rorqual''' is outmatched by the [[Orca]]'s mining speed and Ore Hold.\
==Strategy ==\
*Don't mine in [[War]].\
*Avoid factions that are vulnerable to War.\
*Utilize your high health for tanking out attacks from Aliens and keep on mining.\
*If possible, mine in a [[Galaxy VIP Servers|VIP Server]] to avoid pirating players. However, Aliens still do spawn.\
*Try to check your map every 20 seconds for [[Aliens]] and other enemies.\
*Try to find a [[Factions|Faction]] that has a lot of [[Ores]] clusters around its [[Starbase]] and not as many [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
*If you are mining in a Faction that is at War, only mine near your Starbase.\
*Due to the fact that it is a limited ship use it rarely.\
==Version History==\
*Released in version update .62c2.\
*Received a small color change adding blue (color updated to a more sharper, but realistic version).\
*Received a buff that increased the Ore Hold from 5000 to 5850 and a nerf that decreased the mining range from 7000 studs to 5000 studs.\
*Received a nerf that lowered its mining power from 30&nbsp;m/s to 24&nbsp;m/s.\
*Was nerfed again in update .62d7, which reduced its Ore Hold from 5850 to 5200 and Cargo Hold from 1170 to 750.\
*Reverted a nerf, increasing its mining power from 24&nbsp;m/s to 30&nbsp;m/s and increased its range from 5000 to 7000 in .64c.\
*Was nerfed again in version .65a6, reducing its Cargo Hold from 750 to 520.\
*Re-released for 2020 Fourth of July event.\
*Ore Hold reduced from 5200 to 5000 in version .70a because of ship refund restrictions.\
*Ore Hold increased to 5500 in version .72e4\
*Shield was decreased by 250 points (5,250 to 5,000) in version .75a10.\
*Was given a fourth Patriotic Mining Laser, and its range was extended from 6,175 to 6,500 studs. It's Ore Hold was extended from 5,500 to 6,500 in version .75a10.\
==Trivia ==\
*An event ship for The 4th of July (American independence day) 2018 celebration.\
*Was released along with the [[Patriotic Hercules]].\
* Only takes around 2.5 – 3 minutes to fill up its Ore Hold.\
* When the '''Patriotic Rorqual'''’s [[Turrets|Mining Lasers]] were nerfed, the [[Turrets|Mining Lasers]] had a max mining range of 5000 to 5100.\
*The flags on the '''Patriotic Rorqual''' have 48 stars instead of 50 stars.\
*Was the tied with the [[M Class]] for fastest [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] (in mining speed) until the [[Galaxy]] was added.\
*There's a picture of John F. Kennedy in the interior.\
*Brings in about 6,800 [[Credits]] without any [[Loyalty]] per run, but can earn up to 12,000 - 14,000 Credits.\
*It was shortly re-released in the 2019 Black Friday event.\
*Re-released for the 2020 Fourth Of July event.\
*Used to be way better than the [[Woolly Mammoth]] before the '''Patriotic Rorqual''' got nerfed severely. Today, the '''Patriotic Rorqual''' feels like nothing compared to the now over-powered Woolly Mammoth.\

== Description ==\
The '''Genesis''' is a balanced [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] with fair mobility and powerful weapons, making it great in combat with ships of its class. The only notable blindspot the '''Genesis''' has is at the rear. The ship itself is rather long with turrets placed along the top and bottom. Team-colored plating covers much of the top side, with various darker grey/black parts accenting the brighter colors.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Genesis '''is a simple room with a blue panel sitting in front of the Pilot's seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Good turn speed for a Battleship.\
* Has easily redeemable blind spots, making it difficult to get an edge against it in battle.\
* Balanced health.\
*A good variety of turrets.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Relatively low top speed compared to other [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
* Vulnerable backside.\
* Somewhat weak against [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* Falls to larger, more powerful ships such [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
* Weak explosion damage for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Broadside [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]] can be hard to hit, unless you're experienced.\
*Very weak against most ships without the spinals.\
*Can be easily destroyed by even [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] in many situations.\
== Strategy ==\
* One of the best [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] for [[Pirating]], as its turret firepower can destroy [[Ships]] before they can escape.\
* Use multiple Genesis'''<nowiki/>'''' in a fleet to supply overwhelming turret firepower, even against [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
* If possible, make use of the Spinal weapons, as they are very powerful and can do a lot of [[Shields|Shield]] damage quickly.\
* Front-facing or broadside-facing angles may be most effective to maximize turret lines of sight.\
== Version History ==\
* Suspended temporarily for lag reduction tests.\
* Was unsuspended in version ???\
* Received two broadside [[Spinals]] in .65a5?\
* Light Laser replaced with Light Gatling Laser, Dual Medium Laser replaced with Point Defense Laser in version .66b.\
*Remodeled and buffed in version .66b—Shield increased from 3250 to 3750, Hull from 3000 to 4000, single Large Phaser replaced with 8 Medium Phasers, and turret loadout completely reworked.\
*Received a placeholder remodel and [[Spinals]] reduced from 8 broadside [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] to 4 frontal [[Spinals|Medium Phasers]] in version .67c.\
*1 [[Spinals|Medium Phaser]] and 1 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Laser]] removed, [[Shields|Shield]] reduced to 3000 and [[Hull]] reduced to 3100 in version .69a1.\
*Top Speed reduced from 62 to 60, 1 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Laser]] changed to 1 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Laser]], 3 frontal [[Spinal Weaponry|Medium Phasers]] changed to 6 broadside [[Spinal Weaponry|Medium Phasers]] and received a remodel in version .69f.\
*Explosion size 75 ----> 300 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* It used to be very weak with only one [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]], but after the [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] rebalances in .???, the '''Genesis''' became a deadly adversary not to be underestimated.\
* Before the temporary suspension of this ship, it caused massive amounts of lag while spawned in.\
* The '''Genesis''' was once one of the most widely used [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] in Galaxy, and is again very common in fleet battles in multiple servers.\
* One of its models was shared with the [[Behemoth]], a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] that plays a PvP/Support role like the '''Genesis'''\
* Due to its old model being drawn from the [[Plagued Warship]], the ship was nicknamed the \"Unplagued Warship\" by players.\
* Used to have a frontal teleporter, which allowed you to jump-despawn easily, but that was removed in the current remodel.\
* Lost almost 2000 total health when it was nerfed, in addition to very powerful turrets. This caused many players to move towards other meta ships, although the '''Genesis '''is still a very formidable ship.\
*The current [[Katana]] model is the '''Genesis's''' old model.\

{{Image Infobox\
|title6 = Lucifer Station\

}}\
== Description ==\
'''Frion I''' is currently the second largest planet in Galaxy by the size of its atmosphere, which appears light purple on the outside and is 4,400 studs in diameter. The inside of the atmosphere is an orange-tan color. '''Frion I''' was the second planet to ever be added, the first being [[Earth]] when the game was in Alpha, but that has since been removed. '''Frion I''' has 14,000 [[Shields|shield]] and 14,000 [[hull]] at its base level.\
\
'''Frion I''' can be upgraded twice, level 2 for 3,000 Credits, adding turrets and a large structure atop '''Frion I.''' Level 3 costs 6,000 Credits, adding more turrets.<sup>(Needs clarification)</sup>\
=== <u>Lucifer Station</u> ===\
Lucifer Station is a small station in orbit of '''Frion''' '''I''', which can be entered through a teleporter in the main base. Lucifer Station was also special for 2 reasons: 1, it spawns fighters known as the [[Striker]], the [[Nighthawk]], and the [[Xenophile]]. Previously, it spawned the [[Unarmed Envoy]] and [[Dragonfly]], which were known for being broken or refusing to respawn. 2, it holds 2 NPCs, both of which are used to get the quests known as [[Depthbreaker]] and [[Dining In Hell]], which were both used for the getting a special dreadnought, the [[Kraken]].\
=== <u>Communications tower/Temple</u> ===\
The communications tower on top of Frion I is a method of accessing the cavern in Frion I. For it to appear, Frion I must be level 2. Either by stepping onto the crack atop Frion I or into one of the doors on the tower, you will be teleported to the cave.\
=== <u>Cave</u> ===\
Frion I's cave features a small body of water, and some grasses/ground cover growing. It also features a blue orb that when touched teleports the player to the surface. There are 3 NPCs in the cavern, however, only 1 known as Revy, has a quest down here. The quest is for a weapons part, costing 32,500 Uranium, 6 armored plates, and 180,000 Credits.<sup>(needs verification)</sup> This weapons part is used in the construction of Prototypes.\
=== <u>Ores</u> ===\
No special or specific ores spawn here.\
== Assimilation ==\
'''Frion I''', like any NPC base, can be assimilated when a faction's territory overpowers its own. However, all planets can also be captured -- whichever team brings the planet's health to 0 will, instead of destroying the planet, take over '''Frion I'''.\
\
'''Frion I''' can be a useful base for early factions, as its economy starts off with lower prices. This makes it much easier to upgrade early-on, allowing teams to get a level 2 [[Starbase]], which is required to spawn more powerful warships. When upgraded, it is an excellent defensive point due to its high amount of heavy-hitting turrets.\
== Climate ==\
The climate of '''Frion I''' is not very special; The planet is barren and rocky and isn't able to support life. However, the pressurization required to sustain life in the Starbase appears to have leaked into a cave, as grass is growing under the lab.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in version .56\
* Turrets replaced with 8 orbital turrets in .62a to reduce lag\
* A new mini-base with a boss fight quest can be found in Orbit around Frion as of .64f.\
*Reactor changed from a white cylinder with neon red rings to a neon purple cylinder surrounded by a transparent containment in an unknown version.\
* Lucifer Station started spawning the [[Nighthawk]], [[Dragonfly]] and [[Unarmed Envoy]] in an unknown version.\
[[File:Lucifer1.PNG|thumb|226x226px|The Lucifer Station, an orbital station outside of Frion I]]\
*Orbital turrets were replaced with Heavy Long Range Lasers and Heavy Railguns in .66b\
*Frion Fighters changed to 1 Striker, 1 Xenophile, and 1 Nighthawk in version .73b3\
== Trivia ==\
* Frion I was created by Confinium and MasterPlural and later remodeled by oChaosWarrioro.\
* The first [[:Category:Planets|planet]] to be added to Galaxy after the removal of [[Earth]].\
* [[Aqueous II]] has less health when compared to that of '''Frion I'''. However, it has two more turrets than '''Frion I''' does once fully upgraded.\
* [[Aqueous II]] was generally considered weaker than '''Frion I''', especially in the earlier days of Aqueous' existence.\
*Frion I has a small weakspot underneath the main base. The only way to access it is to go into the range of the turrets and hide behind a small bit of rock. The planet actually hits itself while you can be safe from fire. Only ships smaller than the sixfold work for the operation.\
*Was the largest planet until the addition of [[Pyramus]].\

== Description ==\
The '''Zeus''' is designed to destroy the [[Shields]] of large [[Ships]] and [[Starbase]]s, it can prove a nightmare for other [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]. It is also a prominent tank, having a very strong [[Shields|Shield]], but has proved to be an inefficient PvP vessel, as it is unable to finish off most of its opponents due to the lack of [[Turrets|Kinetic armament]].\
== Appearance ==\
The interior is just a very cramped box with a carpet square for a seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Entirely [[Turrets|Laser]]-based arsenal eats [[Shields]] faster than most non-limited [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
* Excellent [[Shields|Shield]] tank of itself.\
* Overall high health.\
*More accurate weapons than most Dreadnoughts\
*Is faster and does more damage than [[Sagittarius]] at the cost of long-range weaponry.\
*Great against [[Aliens]] due to the high shield DPS.\
*No easily exploitable blindspots.\
*Really thin.\
*Highest turret-based shield DPS of any build menu dreadnought at 344.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* No Kinetic weapons means that it has no efficient way to break [[Hull]].\
* Vulnerable bottom.\
* Practically countered by itself and similar [[Shields|Shield]] breakers.\
* Must point directly at a target for all Turrets to fire.\
* Low [[Hull]] health.\
* Lacks long-range [[Turrets]].\
==<nowiki/>Strategy==\
*This is a good ship to use for [[Shields|Shield]] shredding while sieging or camping at the [[Mega Base]], since it can absorb a lot more damage than other [[Shields|Shield]] breakers.\
*It's also a good siege support as its [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]] would bring down the base [[Shields|Shield]] while 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]] give it a good defense against incoming hostiles.\
*When against the Zeus, approach the ship from the bottom at full speed so that the [[Turrets]] will have a hard time hitting you.\
*Don't use this ship as a frontline tank as its [[Shields]] will quickly be drained by the [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]] from the [[Starbase]].\
*This ship can be pretty good at scaring off bigger ships. Removing their [[Shields]] at a fast rate can force them to warp away, fearing for a possible dive if hulled.\
*Don't tank during sieges, [[Starbase]]s mainly have lasers.\
*Be the first one to attack, if you arrive later targets might be hulled and you won't be very useful.\
*Know which ships are shield tanks when deciding which to attack. Ships with mainly shield health will often stand no chance against you.\
*Since it can't do much hull damage, the Zeus is better suited for defense, as it can scare off attackers by quickly removing their shields and leaving them vulnerable.\
== Version History ==\
* Nerfed in .58b, removed a [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]] and a [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannon]] in exchange for a [[Turrets|Medium Laser]].\
* Buffed in .58c, [[Shields|Shield]] was boosted by 2000.\
* Buffed in .61e4, [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] were boosted.\
* Buffed in .63h, [[Turrets|Medium Laser]] switched to a [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]], and pre existing [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]] switched to [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]].\
* [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]] replaced with [[Turrets|Dual Medium Lasers]] and [[Shields|Shield]] increased to 8750 in .65b.\
* 2 [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]] replaced with [[Turrets|Point Defence Lasers]] and [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] together with [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]] replaced with [[Turrets|Rapid Fire Lasers]] in .66b\
* Turnspeed increased from 0.06 to 0.08 in version .66b\
* Received a remodel in version .66n.\
* 3 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] switched out with 2 [[Turrets|Triple Capital Turrets]] and a [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Laser]] in version .68e.\
* Turnspeed increased from 0.1 to 0.12, Speed increased from 45 to 55, Acceleration increased from 5 to 25, 2 [[Turrets|Triple Capital Lasers]] and 1 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Laser]] switched out for 5 [[Turrets|SR PDLs]], one [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defence Laser]] added in version .74b14\
*Explosion Size 170 ----> 670 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The [[Turrets|Turret]] placements were updated on 10/19/2016.\
* Received several remodels.\
* Named after the Greek God '''Zeus'''.\
* Has a limited counterpart, the [[Jupiter]]\
* Extremely rare to see as very few players have the ship, much less use it, due to its poor weapon configuration.\
* As of version .74b14, Zeus has more DPS than [[Jupiter]], its limited counterpart. \

==Description==\
The '''Hevnetier''' is a large [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] that is fairly mobile for its size. There are two empty hangars to the left and right of the ship. The front of the ship contains its [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]-like fighter, the [[Elanis]]\

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
==Appearance ==\
The '''Hevnetier''' has a simple interior, being a box with a screen at the front, containing a stool that is the pilot's seat, two more seats for fighter pilots and four teleporters. The one at the back leads to outside of the ship. The ones on the left and right leads to the respective hangers. The one at the front leads to the [[Elanis]].\
==Advantages==\
*Has a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] comparable to a battleship.\
*Well armed for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
*Good support ship for fleets and sieges.\
*Has little to no reliance on using [[AI Fighters]], as only 1 player is needed.\
* High [[Hull]] damage.\
*Cheap for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*The Carrier itself lacks [[Spinals|Spinal]] firepower.\
*Rather low [[Shields|Shield]] damage compared to [[Hull]] damage.\
*Has the lowest fighter count in the game, a total count of '''1'''.\
*Turrets may have a hard time hitting small ships.\
*Sluggish.\
*Huge blind-spot under the ship.\
*Rather low health for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
== Strategy==\
*It can be used as a support [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] in sieges and fleets by itself and carrying a portable [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] to engage against capital ships, as well as providing defense against smaller ships.\
*Useful in fleets, as it provides an extremely powerful and disposable Fighter.\
*Get a skilled pilot in the [[Elanis]]. You are now just a dreadnought with 7 turrets, congratulations.\
*The low shield DPS of the carrier can be offset-ted by the high shield DPS of the [[Elanis]] and vice versa.\
*Engage ships that are above you as all of the turrets can fire at once.\
*Only fight in this ship with a fleet, as small, agile ships can easily exploit your blind-spot under you.\
==Version History==\
*In .58b2 the old model's Interior was removed, leaving only an empty shell with [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Remodeled in .64f.\
*Received a Cargo Hold buff from 75 to 1000 in .65b.\
*Received a total [[Turrets|Turret]] makeover in .65b.\
*Received a [[Shields|Shield]] buff in .65b.\
*Shield increased from 5350 to 9000 and loadout changed to 1 [[Turrets|Large Laser]], 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]] and 3 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] in version .68d.\
*Cargo Hold increased from 1000 to 2000, [[Shields|Shield]] reduced from 9000 to 6500, [[Hull]] increased from 5000 to 6000, Top Speed reduced to 28, Turn Speed increased to 0.09, 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]] and 1 [[Turrets|Heavy Laser]] changed to 3 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]]; 2 [[Blitz]]es, 1 [[Frenzy]], 1 [[Fury]] and 1 [[Xenophile]] switched out with 2 [[Nighthawk]] and 1 [[Elanis]]; received a remodel in version .69a2.\
*Turret placement modified in version.69e?\
*Reworked in version .75a10. Shields 6500 to 7500, Hull 6000 to 6500. Loses 1 Triple Heavy Laser and 6 Heavy Flak cannons for 2 Capital Triple Cannons, 2 Quad Advanced Medium Cannons, 2 Triple Medium Cannons and 1 Triple Medium Laser. Loses 2 Nighthawks and the [[Elanis]] gains a buff.\
==Trivia==\
*It was part of a batch of [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] added in the game in .46, when farterbotz pushed to have more [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] other than the [[Stormbringer]].\
*The '''Hevnetier's '''old model was the smallest and weakest carrier until the [[Vanguard]] was added to the game.\
*The old model used to spawn random [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Formerly used to carry the fighters [[Xenophile]]s, [[Blitz]], [[Frenzy]] and the [[Nighthawk]].\
*One of the only 2 [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] to house a Battleship like fighter: The [[Elanis]], while the other carrier being [[Annihilator]] and it's fighter, the [[A - Bionicle]].\
* One of the only 2 playable ships that has an affiliation with the alien faction [[Slarfie]], the other ship being the [[Slipstream]].\
*Resembles the Nyx, a supercarrier from EVE online\
*Has the lowest fighter count in the game, '''1'''.\

== Description ==\
The '''Ampharos''' is a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] that consists of a large spine with small wings.\
\
The '''Ampharos''' is great for defending heavy [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] ships during a siege along with defending a base against small [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] trying to distract the base's [[Turrets]] by using its [[turrets]] to shred the small ships.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Ampharos''' is very simple. You enter the ship through a teleporter located at the top and get sent into a small room containing a pilot seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Absolutely shreds small [[ships]] (although it is slightly more difficult to destroy more powerful ones like the [[Zhen]] and [[Nightmare]]).\
* High mobility.\
* Decent [[Spinals]].\
* Powerful [[Turrets]].\
* Extremely good at fleet support.\
* 4th fastest [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] in the game, right behind the [[Witch]].\
* Decent Interior if you care about that.\
*Great for taking down aliens.\
* A great ship for wrecking the [[Hawklight]]\
*The thin, vertical shape of this ship makes dodging spinals and turret fire much easier.\
*Faster and better spinals than its AA counterpart, the [[Loyalist]]\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Weak against other [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
* Can't siege due to the lack of [[Turrets|Railguns]] and Heavy Weaponry.\
*Easier to hit from the sides as it appears bigger at that angle, making it susceptible to broadside ships such as [[Genesis]] or [[Behemoth]].\
*Less firepower than the '''Ampharos's''' ,The [[Loyalist]], which makes the '''Ampharos''' a worse choice when fighting other [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]\
== Strategy ==\
* It's close range rapid-fire armament makes it ideal for fighting small, fast [[ships]], such as the [[Razor Wing]].\
* Having multiple '''Ampharos'''<nowiki/>' alongside [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] (above, sides, and bottom) can be the difference in victory or defeat, as the [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] can focus completely on the base or other threats while you deal with the smaller [[ships]].\
* It is a good ship for pirating or escort, however, it is not as mobile as other combat ships such as [[Sixfold]] or [[Grievion]].\
* Don't try to attack a [[Starbase]], as you are a giant target and will quickly get shredded by the [[Turrets|Large Lasers]].\
* Try to get under the ship you are attacking, as your [[Turrets]] all fire upwards. That way, you can get the most damage out as possible.\
* When attacking a [[Nyx]], the '''Ampharos''' is incredible as it can destroy [[Nixesion]]s with ease.\
* This ship CAN be used in a siege to protect larger ships from [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] and [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]] but NEVER attack the starbase/planet directly.\
* You could wreck a [[Hawklight]] if you're experienced, fire from the bottom of the [[Hawklight]].\
== Version History ==\
* The model of the ship was remade in update .53 for unknown reasons.\
* Changed in .63h to have nearly 1000 more health in each stat, replace the [[Turrets|Light Cannons]] with dual [[Turrets|Medium Cannons]], and increased the price.\
* Max Shield increased to 3350 from 3150 in .65b\
* Medium Lasers replaced with Point Defense Lasers in version .66b\
*Remodeled in version .66b, as well as receiving buffs, with its hull going from 2750 to 3250, its two Point Defense Lasers becoming two Heavy Point Defense Lasers, and it 2 Dual Medium Cannons becoming 2 Medium Flak Cannons.\
*Explosion size 50 ----> 285 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* On the lower bridge, there is a table with a 3D image of the old [[Mega Base]].\
* This ship has the exact same name as Ampharos from the Pokémon series.\
* One of the five ships chosen to be remodeled as a Halloween ship, this one being the [[Bone Ampharos]] or \"Flying Skelly\"\
*Mostly called \"amp\" or \"amph\" in game\
* Featured many times on Sean Morabito's old YouTube videos.\
* When remodeled in .66b, it received an ungodly explosion damage of 7k to shields. This was used to destroy many dreadnoughts before it was patched. These fallen dreadnoughts are still on display in the refund-request channel of the Galaxy Discord Server.\
* Its latest model made it the first vertically oriented battleship, following on the steps of the [[Slipstream]], the first of all vertical [[ships]] in Galaxy.\
* Because of the similarities with the [[Slipstream]], the Ampharos is sometimes called the \"Baby Slip\"\
* The new model is based on the Vert 22 from the indie space game SpaceBourne.\

== Description ==\
The '''Rorqual''' is the fifth most expensive and the fifth largest of all non-limited [[:Category:Miner|Miners]]. It has 3 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]]. Its movement speed is very slow, but it can mine fast and can fit a substantial amount of [[Ores]] in its cargo hold. Huge amounts of [[Credits]] can be made if used in sync with a [[Prepravca]] or another large trader. For its class, it has a very large amount of [[Shields]] and [[Hull]] (2500/5000). It has a mining range of 5500 studs and takes a minimum of ~333 seconds to fill up its hold.\
== Appearance ==\
The back of the '''Rorqual''' contains a small teleporter to the cockpit, which is just a small metal box. In front of the gray pilot's seat, you will see a white screen that has colorful buttons. There is also a fluorescent light above the screen, lighting up the room.\
== Advantages ==\
* Third-highest Cargo Hold of all obtainable Miners.\
* Large [[Ores]] Hold.\
* Earns a very high amount of [[Credits]].\
* Tied with its VIP counterpart, the [[Mammoth]] for 3rd highest health of all non-limited [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
* Can tank quite a bit of damage. This makes [[Aliens]] much less of a threat while [[Mining]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Slow top speed and turn speed.\
* It can take a while to get a full Ore Hold, usually taking 6–7 minutes to fill up.\
* Expensive.\
* The slow pace and vulnerability of the '''Rorqual '''make it a prime target for [[Pirating|Pirates]].\
* The positioning of the [[Turrets|Lasers]] makes it so that you have to face directly toward the target [[Ores]] in order to mine it with maximum efficiency.\
* [[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
* Mines slightly slower than the [[M Class]].\
== Safety ==\
* Make sure you always check if any enemies are coming every 30 seconds, either by looking around or on the [[Minimap]].\
* Always [[Mining|Mine]] in a peaceful [[Factions|Faction]], so you don't risk being attacked.\
* Stay close to friendly combat ships when possible. They can help protect you from enemies.\
* If you are [[Mining]] in a faction that is at [[War]], only mine near your [[Starbase]].\
* If you have access to one, [[Mining|Mine]] in a [[Galaxy VIP Servers|VIP Server]] to ensure safety from other players, but beware of swarms of [[Aliens]].\
\
* Don't mine at the [[Mega Base]] If you are at war, and you aren't protected.\
\
* Try finding a [[Factions|Faction]] that has a lot of [[Ores]] around its [[Starbase]] and is not using as many [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
* Use your health to escape [[Pirates]]. When at war with someone more powerful than you, immediately go to your [[Factions|Faction]] and dock. Your immense amount of health will make sure you will survive some attackers.\
==Version History==\
*Received a remodel in ?\
*Received a small buff in .59a so people can choose this over the [[Mammoth]].\
*Received a buff around .59b - .59c (real version unknown) that added 1000 Ore Hold and an extra [[Turrets|Small Mining Laser]].\
*Received a nerf that removed the extra [[Turrets|Small Mining Laser]] in around .59d, but the Ore Hold wasn't affected by the nerf.\
*Received a buff that increased its [[Mining]] range by 50%.\
*Received a nerf around .60d that removed a [[Turrets|Medium Mining Laser]] on top of the ship.\
*Nerf was reversed in .60d that removed the [[Turrets|Medium Mining Laser]] on top of the ship.\
*Received a massive buff in .61e4 that doubled health and added ''some'' damage resistance.\
*Received another remodel, in .61h\
*Buff in .61h(?) that added 500 [[Shields|Shield]], 1000 [[Hull]], [[Warp Drive]], but removed 1000 Ore Hold and 30 Top Speed.\
*Buff in .61i that increased the [[Mining]] range by 1000.\
*Explosion range decreased from 250 to 125 in .65b.\
*Shields and Hull decreased from 2,500/5,000 to 2,000/4,000 in .75a10.\
==Trivia==\
* It is the 4th largest obtainable [https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/Category%3AMiner Miner], behind the [https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/Mammoth Mammoth],[https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/M_Class M Class] , and [[Orca]].\
* Brings in about 6,550 credits without any Loyalty per run, but can earn up to 13500.\
* The ship was chosen for the 4th of July Event. The event ship, the [https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/Patriotic_Rorqual Patriotic Rorqual], is better in terms of health, mining range, mining speed, and [[Ores]] mined per second.\
* The original '''Rorqual''' model was very similar to [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Rorqual a ship of the same name] in EVE Online.\
* One of the most commonly used Miners.\

== Description ==\
The '''Andromeda''' is a needle-like ship and is decently fast for its class. It also has a high spinal damage output for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]. Recommended only for experienced players as it requires good aim and situational awareness to achieve its full potential. Its an extremely high risk high reward dreadnought, And recommended to use in coordinated pushes with teammates.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Andromeda''' has a somewhat small interior, accessible only by a teleporter on the back of the ship. The interior is a wide room with a seat, teleporter, and hatch to a lower floor. The bottom floor has a desk with a chair and some containers. There are 2 papers with Contracts on them stating a remodel for [[Banshee]] and Project X-03. The Banshee Contract has a 250,000 [[Credits|Credit]] agreement and the Project X-03 is a 20,000,000 Credit agreement.\
== Advantages ==\
* Extremely high total DPS if the user can aim [[Spinals]] well.\
* Great for taking down large, slow ships like other dreadnoughts.\
*Somewhat high top speed of its class, having 20 less top speed than the [[Leviathan]].\
* Spinals can be used to siege [[Starbase]]s from afar while taking minimal damage.\
* Relatively cheap for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* '''MUST '''be experienced with Spinals or your low health will catch up to you very quickly.\
* Has trouble against smaller [[Ships]].\
* Must own the [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass]] to build this ship.\
* Vulnerable backside.\
* No Turrets.\
* Has the third lowest total health of all Dreadnoughts, only beaten by the [[SR-71]] stealth dreadnought, and the Avalon\
* Its unique shape and bright colors make it easy to identify from a distance.\
*Low health and acceleration makes attacking ships a bad idea.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use [[Warp Drive|Warp]] to quickly reposition if you get caught in a bad spot.\
* Make sure to not attack ships or [[Starbase]]s without another ship with Anti-[[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]]/Anti-[[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] capabilities.\
* Use the range of its Spinals to outgun other Dreadnoughts effectively.\
*Use it as an extra gun during sieges, its main strong suit is DPS.\
*Best used in fleet wars, let your teammates tank while you do huge damage to the enemies.\
== Version History ==\
* Turn Speed increased from 0.05 to 0.07 in version .64f.\
* Received Turrets in .65b.\
* Received a Health buff in .65b. that boosted [[Shields]] from 4250 to 5000 and [[Hull]] from 4500 to 4850. It also received a Turn Speed buff that boosted Turn Speed from 0.07 to 0.09.\
* Received a new remodel in .65b.\
* Turn speed reduced from 0.07 to 0.05, max Shield reduced from 5000 to 4650 in version .65b.\
* Spinal barrels reduced to 5 Huge Cannons and 5 Large Phasers, Turn Speed increased to 0.18, 3 Triple Heavy Cannons and 3 Triple Heavy Lasers changed to 6 Dual Medium Cannons in version .69a1.\
*Lost 1 phaser but therefore got all of its other phasers upgraded from Large to Huge in version .70c8.\
*Gained a Phaser and a Cannon in version .72d.\
*Explosion Size 126 ----> 600 .75a12\
*10 Huge Phasers and 10 Huge Cannons, Removed turrets .75a20\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Andromeda''' was the first Spinal-based Dreadnought in [https://www.roblox.com/games/200330616/Galaxy Galaxy].\
* The '''Andromeda''' is named after the closest major galaxy to the Milky Way, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy Andromeda galaxy].\
* It was the first VIP [[Ships#Dreadnought Class|Dreadnought]] in the game and is the second most expensive [[:Category:VIP Ship|VIP ship]] available.\
* This ship was common on Galaxy Arcade due to it being free with the VIP gamepass, but it was given its own gamepass in recent updates.\
* <s>The floating Turrets resemble the ones on the [[Reaper]] and [[Grim]].</s> (Turrets were removed)\
* Its model is based off [https://universeatwar.fandom.com/wiki/Vertigo Vertigo], the Stealth hero of Novus and cryptography and communications protocol from ''Universe At War''.\
* Originally was going to be a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
* Project Banshee, which can be found referenced in the interior, is a reference to the [[Banshee]] which was made by Wiscyy, the same person that made the current '''Andromeda''' model. Project X-03 may be a reference to the [[Prototype X-3]].\

==Description ==\
The '''Wasp''' is the smallest [[:Category:Miner|Miner]]-class ship, which is given to all new players in Galaxy. Compared to other [[:Category:Miner|Miners]], it is lacking in terms of mining speed and ore hold, and has a small mining range of 4500 studs. The '''Wasp''' is also used for distracting base [[Turrets]] because it has a high top speed and players are not afraid to lose it. '''Wasps''' cost nothing and can be rebuilt immediately upon destruction, meaning players will always have a new one in their inventory.\
==Appearance==\
The Wasp is a couple of blocks and a seat. As we appreciate you guys, we made the pilot's seat completely open to space.\
==Advantages==\
*Very fast.\
*Small, making it hard to target.\
*It's free.\
*It can somewhat defend itself, capable of soloing a [[Nighthawk]], with a competent pilot.\
*Great distractor / AI baiting ship due to being free.\
==Disadvantages  ==\
*Very slow mining speed, slowest of almost every other [[:Category:Miner|Miners]], only miners that have no turrets/have non-mining laser turrets have the slowest mining speed (at 0).\
*Low [[Hull]] and [[Shields|Shield]] health.\
*Tiny Ore Hold. (Can only hold 250 [[Ores|Ore]].)\
*Often targeted by [[Aliens|Aliens,]] like many other [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
*Very small explosion value of only 3.\
*Even if it can somewhat defend itself, Mining Lasers are shield-based, meaning that it can't deal with ships that have low to high amounts of [[Hull]], not to mention the turret DPS of only 4.\
==Strategy==\
*If you have a level 1 warehouse, you do not have to worry about safety or losing your ship (to non AI) due to New Player Immunity.\
*Try mining in a peaceful [[Factions|Faction]] or the U.N.E. faction to reduce your risk of being killed by other players.\
*Stay close to friendly combat ships when possible, as they can serve as help and protect you from enemies. This is less reliable than with other mining ships, however, since most people won’t care to protect a free ship.\
*If you are mining in a faction that is at [[War]] (which is not recommended), try staying close to your [[Starbase]], so you can dock as fast as possible.\
*Don't mine at the [[Mega Base]] if you are at [[War]] and you aren't protected. (Unless you have new player protection).\
* This ship is free, so you can take any risks, just remember that if you are destroyed, you lose all the ore in your ore hold.\
*Due to the ship being small and fast, the ship can be used to scout enemy fleets for wars. The ship is also good for this task because there is no risk if you lose the ship as it's free, meaning you can easily spam this ship as a distraction.\
*You can distract player ships with this. Despite Wasps being free and worthless to destroy, many people will decide to shoot them for fun, which means they aren’t shooting something valuable.\
== Version History==\
*Received a remodel in version .56b.\
*[[Warp Drive]] added in version .61h1?\
*Received a trail and a remodel in version .66b.\
==Trivia==\
*Along with the [[Wyrm]], it is automatically given to any new player.\
*Commonly used to attempt to glitch ships such as [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]. This is '''bannable''' as stated in the [[Galaxy Rules]].\
* Occasionally used to block the [[Spinals]] of larger ships during sieges, due to its status as a free ship allowing it to be destroyed at no cost, though is fairly hard.\
* Smallest [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] currently in Galaxy.\
*Brings in about 312 [[Credits]] without any [[Loyalty]] per run, but can earn up to 562 [[Credits]].\
*This ship has eight limited variants, in the form of the [[Coal Wasp]], the [[Festive Wasp]], the [[Prototype X-3]], the [[Blue Torp Wasp]], the [[Patriotic Wasp]], the [[3D Printed Wasp]], the [[Waspinator]], and finally the [[Wasp?]]\
*It is used in the mining tutorial of the game.\
*The '''Wasp''' was originally called a Mining Frigate in Pre-Alpha.\
*One of only two free and continuously available ships in the game, the other being the [[Wyrm]].\
*Lowest health out of all non-limited ships, excluding [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*The Wasp has been made into a meme in the Galaxy community as \"The best ship\" because of how low levelled it is. \
\
* Technically it '''''is''''' the best ship, due to the fact that it’s free but can deal damage. You can infinitely damage people with wasps. However, this isn’t correct normally, because it has extremely low DPS and health, so Wasp spamming is very impractical for destroying anything.\
* The Wasp can get into the Mega Base, through the docks by fitting through. This is the same with other smaller ships.\
*Had a unique reskin for the [[Easter event 2022]] along with the [[Wyrm]].\

==Description==\
The '''Tempest''' is a PvP/Support [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] focused on escorting fleets.\
\
The front of the ship has two Medium Lasers mounted on it at a slight angle giving it a sleek appearance, along with most of the other [[Turrets]].\
\
As mentioned earlier, it is an excellent escort ship for fleets such as sieging fleets to take down small and large ships alike.\
==Appearance==\
The Tempest's interior is rather simple, featuring an illuminated grey room with metal tiles for a floor and a neon purple ceiling. Near the teleporter, there is a logo, and at the other end a neon purple orb acting as the pilot's seat.\
==Advantages==\
*Excellent Turret placement greatly protects it from smaller [[Ships]].\
*Accurate yet high damage turrets help with pest control of smaller ships.\
*Smallest blind spot of all Dreadnoughts.\
*Does well against other [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], despite its description saying otherwise.\
*Versatility allows this ship to be flexible in its uses (support, PvP, assaulting, etc.).\
*Good maneuverability for a Dreadnought.\
*Somewhat high turret damage output for a dreadnought, almost being on par with the [[Apocalypse]]; giving it high enough damage output to be an extremely dangerous threat to sub-capital ships that lack the speed to nullify the accuracy of the ship's armament.\
==Disadvantages ==\
*Lacks long-range turrets.\
*Extremely expensive for a build menu Dreadnought, coming in at the most expensive non-limited/advanced [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] you can buy.\
*Despite how small they are, the rear and broadside blind spots can be an issue if the pilot is not using the Tempest's maneuverability to their advantage.\
*Falls short on firepower compared to other Dreadnoughts\
==Strategy==\
*Get as close as you can if you are fighting ships so your [[Turrets]] can get in range.\
*In order to aim all Turrets on a single target, you must aim the nose directly at the target.\
*Try to stay in enemy blind spots to avoid damage.\
*When fighting nimble ships, keep pace with them to the best of your ability in both speed and direction; to maximize the accuracy of your turrets.\
*Support your team by providing AA (anti air) Support.\
==Version History==\
*Nerfed before release. Used to have 6 Large Phasers and 23 more Speed. Also had a part reduction.\
*Did not have a Cargo Hold until .52d.\
* Used to use an odd weld script resulting in offset parts, which as of version .52i has been fixed.\
*Used to have a good interior but it was stripped out to lower the part count as it made the game lag.\
*Remodeled once again by oChaosWarrioro, Interior brought back, even lower part count than before (313).\
* Reverted to the original model with only a bridge interior and an elegant exterior.\
*.62a Received a change to its Flak Cannons being swapped over to Dual Gatling Cannons, lost its Huge Cannons as they were swapped to Large Cannons.\
* Cannon Spinals reverted to Huge back from Large in .65b.\
* Lasers swapped with Point Defense Lasers in version .66b?\
*Buffed in version .66b—All turrets upgraded to Large/Capital versions.\
*Cargo hold and price nerfed significantly in version .66b.\
* Spinals removed, Shield increased from 5650 -> 6000 in version .68b.\
* 1 Capital Triple Laser changed to a Capital Triple Cannon, Heavy Point Defense Lasers switched out with their Medium variants and 1 Heavy Flak Cannon replaced with a Point Defense Laser in version .69a1.\
* Received a Medium Flak Cannon in version .71b, bringing the turret count to 10.\
*Medium PDLs replaced with Heavy PDLs, Medium Flak Cannons replaced with Heavy Flak Cannons, added 4/4 small phaser/cannon spinals, top speed buffed to 64, acceleration buffed to 10 in version .73a3\
*Explosion Size 120 ----> 780 .75a12\
*Ship reworked in version .75a23:\
**Spinal armament removed.\
**Turret armament changed from 1 Capital Triple Laser, 1 Capital Triple Cannon, 3 Heavy Flak Cannons, and 5 Heavy Point Defence Lasers to 2 Super Flak Cannons, 2 Heavy Flak Cannons, 2 Super PDLs, and 2 Heavy Point Defence Lasers.\
**Top Speed increased from 64 to 80.\
*Turret armament adjusted; 1 Super Flak Cannon added and 2 Heavy Flak Cannons replaced with 2 Super Flak Cannons (2 Super Flak Cannons, 2 Heavy Flak Cannons, 2 Super PDLs, 2 Heavy Point Defence Lasers --> 5 Super Flak Cannons, 2 Super PDLs, 2 Heavy Point Defense Lasers) in version .75a23.\
==Trivia==\
*Used to be the only Dreadnought with Flak Cannons.\
*Featured on Sean Morabito's YouTube Channel where he pirated Miners.\
*Previously had spinal cannons with a unique sound.\
*Name may be a small reference to Field of Battle, Galaxy's sibling game created by the same creator.\
*Tempest means a strong storm.\
*The back is somewhat similar to the [[Devestation|Devastation]].\
*Was one of the first two ships to have 10 turrets along with the [[Warlock]].\

The '''Abaddon''' is a powerful [[:Category:Dreadnought|'''Dreadnought''']] added in the [[:Category:Halloween 2019|2019 Halloween Event]].\
\
==Description==\
The '''Abaddon''' is a long range, spinal-focused counterpart of the [[Azreal]].\
\
This ship excels at [[Galaxy Terminology|Diving]] Ships with it's high alpha and long range, and powerful Spinals.\
==Appearance==\
The Abaddon is a rather long and slim [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreadnought]] with many fins jutting out of the ship including 4 Large inverted fins on the back. It has 2 Large Spinal Barrels attached to the front of the ship in a shotgun pattern, and these emit sparking particles. It has many windows decorating it's entire hull and the shape bears a striking resemblance to its sister ship the [[Azreal]].\
\
Its shape and fins make it somewhat resemble a fish.\

The '''Abaddon''' shares the same interior as the [[Azreal]] and [[Lucifer]], with a black, foggy hallway. At the front, there is a yellow glowing orb with electricity coming out of it, and in front of it there is yellow text that says <span style=\"color:#ffd424\">''\"'''''LANCER ABADDON ONLINE'''''\".''</span>\
[[File:HalloweenAmbienceII.mp4|thumb|Ambience of the Abaddon|none]]\
== Advantages==\
* High maneuverability, makes it easier to escape combat situations without taking too much damage.\
*Good siege ship, Capable of destroying [[Starbase]]s with ease.\
* Overall high DPS, from its [[Spinal Weaponry]].\
*High alpha damage, being more than that of the [[Azreal]].\
*High health for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought.]]\
*Somewhat accurate turrets can hit ships as small as [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*Will be hunted, due to it being a limited ship.\
*Unbalanced Shield Health compared to Hull, making it vulnerable against Hull-Breakers.\
*Must be facing towards the target to use all weapons.\
* Must be good at hitting [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]], as they make up most of the DPS.\
*Large [[Galaxy Terminology|Blindspots]] underneath and on the back of the ship.\
*Extremely expensive for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], having high Material Costs and costing a Class B [[Permits|Permit]].\
* People will know when it is spawned because of its ambiance being able to be heard from 100k studs away and people may also ask you to despawn your ship because of its loud ambiance.\
==Strategy==\
*Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.\
*Pay attention and check the Minimap often to make sure you're not about to be ambushed. Your limited status means you must always avoid damage as much as possible.\
*The Abaddon is decently maneuverable for a Dreadnought, but do not go against opponents who are smaller and faster than you.\
*Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.\
*Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship. The Abaddon can do tremendous amounts of damage, but being targeted greatly increases your chances of being destroyed.\
*Stay away from Hull-Breakers like [[Hawklight]], as your [[Hull]] has almost 1.5x the amount of your [[Shields]].\
==Version History==\
*Received a 45% DPS nerf not long after being released in version .66b\
*[[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] count increased from 6/6 to 7/7 in version .73a.\
*Class B [[Permits|Permit]] changed to a Class C Permit and Spinal count reduced from 7/7 to 6/6 in version .73a3.\
*Acceleration increased from 12 to 26 and Cargo Hold increased from 250 to 1500 in an unknown version.\
*Explosion Size 165 ----> 910 in vetrsion .75a12\
*Class C [[Permits|Permit]] price reverted back to Class B in an unknown version.\
*Gains 1 Huge Phaser in version .75a20.\
*Remodeled and Spinal firing arcs realigned by robloxgold14 in version .75a20.\
*Renamed to Abaddon in version .75a20\
==Trivia==\
*The ship is similar to the [[Hyperion]], as both are siege-based counterparts of ships.\
*While this ship was made to siege [[Starbase]]s, it's counterpart, the [[Azreal]], was made to fight other ships, mostly strong ones.\
*The first '''Abaddon''' to die belonged to aleksjan25. It was destroyed by TheKingOfNoobs21's [[Azreal]] .\
*Similarly to [[Azreal]], has an ambience that plays when spawned and was used by the [[Rift Guardian]] and [[Frog]] as well.\
*This ship used to have the name '''Abbadon''', which was actually a misspelling of the demon it's based on; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaddon%7CAbaddon The Abaddon.]\
*Its first model was identical to the [[Azreal]], but with different colors.\

The '''''Hawklight''''' is generally considered to be one of the strongest [[:Category:Battleship|'''Battleships''']] in Galaxy, especially as a PvP ship.\
==Description==\
A popular [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] for new and experienced players alike. Many players have used the '''Hawklight''' for [[Sieging|Sieges]]; however, it also shines as a PvP ship. Its powerful array of [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]] allow it to quickly destroy ships of many different sizes. The placement of the Turrets makes it very easy to land the first few hits, but if facing more agile ships with turn speeds comparable to the [[Gryphon]], the '''Hawklight''' will have difficulty landing powerful hits. One could consider this ship a hull-breaking counterpart to the [[Warden]], an extremely similar ship with a shield-oriented weapons array being the only feature that sets it apart from the '''Hawklight'''.\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Hawklight''' is pretty normal inside. You'll enter an empty dock port with a single teleporter to the bridge, and inside the bridge is a fairly detailed room with a single pilot's seat facing an orange triangle. The back of the triangle is another white triangle, and it is rather weird. There are two doors on the side that do not lead anywhere and cannot be walked through.\
==Advantages==\
*Decent health pool, especially towards [[Shields]].\
*Perfect for destroying attacking or defending [[Ships]] in a siege or counter-siege.\
*Powerful spinals and kinetic oriented turret armament allows this ship to shred [[Hull]]\
*Cheap compared to other battleships.\
*Quite fast for a battleship.\
==Disadvantages==\
*While it is not technically a blind spot, the bottom of the ship is rather exposed to tiny, agile Ships.\
*Hard to damage [[Hull]] if you can't aim with [[Spinals]].\
*Several blind spots.\
*Hull health is somewhat lower compared to Shields.\
==Strategy==\
*It is a great ship for fighting [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] and other large ships, however, do not attack faster, more agile ships.\
*Unless you're a skilled pilot, warp away from ships like the [[Razor Wing]].\
*Great ship for [[Sieging|Sieges]] and counter-sieges, use it for that.\
*The''' '''Hawklight''''' '''''is effective at destroying Hull-Focused Opponents with its 10 Medium Cannons.\
*Don't let enemy ships get underneath you, instead get underneath them to hit your Turrets or in front of them to fire your Spinals.\
* Try and stay away from shield tanks, since the Hawklight is focused on hull.\
* In PvP, never let your opponent get below you, always warp under them.\
*Once hulled, immediately warp back to a friendly starbase or such and dock ASAP. As people will likely chase you down once they see that you're hulled. If they do follow you to your starbase, de-spawn and heal another time. Don't take any chances.\
==Version History==\
*Added in the [[Halloween Event 2016]].\
*Received a remodel in update ??.\
*Changed in .63h to replace one Medium Laser with a Heavy Laser, increased Hull health by 250, and price changed.\
* Max Shield increased to 3050 from 2750 in .65b\
*Remodeled in version .66b, also receiving a buff, with its Shield health going from 3050 to 4150, its hull from 2350 to 2750, as well as gaining 2 more Dual Medium Cannons.\
* 2 Medium Cannons and 1 Triple Heavy Laser removed and Shield reduced to 3150 removed in version .69a1.\
*6 spinal Medium Cannons increased to 8 Medium Cannons in version .72f1.\
*8 Medium Cannons increased to 10 Medium Cannons, and Point Defence Laser replaced with Heavy Point Defence Laser in version .75a5.\
*Explosion Size 100 ----> 320 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*When the game first came out this was the largest ship in the game.\
*This ship is most likely named after Champion Hawklight from Field of Battle; a game also created by [[Rcouret]].\
*Since this ship is one of the earliest ships to be added, several other ships reference it in their descriptions.\
*Featured in the main thumbnail for Galaxy.\
*Had a pumpkin attached to the old model for Halloween 2016.\
*This ship used to be asymmetrical with its third model, as the smaller wings differed in size, shape, and position.\
*This ship was chosen for the [[Halloween Event 2018]] as a remade Halloween Ship and has been remade as the [[Hallowlight]].\
*At one point, it was the most popular [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] in the game.\
*The classic '''Hawklight''' returned for the [[:Category:Retro Ship Event 2019|Retro Ship Event 2019]] and [[Black Friday Event 2019]] as the [[Retro Hawklight]].\
*Despite having 8 total spinal barrels on the model, it has 10 usable barrels.\
* The hawklight has the same mobility as the [[Warden]], as well as almost the exact opposite weapon loadout and shield/hull.\

== Description ==\
The '''Stormbringer''' is a pretty well-balanced ship in terms of weaponry. While the turret armament is focused on lasers, the ship also possesses 2 medium cannons for dealing damage to a ship's hull once an its shield has been shredded by the vast laser array. The '''Stormbringer''' can be considered the shield-breaking counterpart of the [[Borealis]], another carrier. Relationships like these have been seen before, like the [[Hawklight]] and [[Warden]], for instance.\
\
It carries 6 '''[[Typhoon|Typhoons.]]'''\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Stormbringer<nowiki>'</nowiki>s''' bridge is exceedingly basic, being a plain grey cuboid-shaped room with a single wool-textured pad on the floor that acts as the pilot seat. Don't worry, the ship building hangar is working on building the interior right now. The fighter bay is a small, cramped little dark grey compartment that opens out of dorsal side of the ship near the stern, housing the fighters. There are neon white accents on the floor underneath each fighter, perhaps outlining landing pads. Overall, the fighter bay is vaguely resemblant of that of a real aircraft carrier, except it is dug into the ship and blanketed over the top by a transparent shield-like surface. The ship itself is very long. Most of its surfaces are littered with armour plating in various shades of grey and streaks of neon orange, except from the ventral side, which is host to a number of vertical protrusions. The most notable of these protrusions looks rather like a hydrofoil's foil. It is also reminiscent of the massive vertical protrusion on the Borealis' underbelly.\
== Advantages ==\
* Has a decent amount of fighters.\
* Great [[Shields|shield]] DPS.\
* Low risk as it is the cheapest carrier in the game.\
*Great [[hull]] health.\
*Devastating [[Nuking|Nuke]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Not very maneuverable.\
*Lacklustre hull DPS. Even the fighters' cannons pale in comparison to their phasers.\
* Can't face off against bigger [[Ships]] without the help of the [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
* Fighter bay is completely open, allowing for small ships such as fighters, frigates, destroyers, cruisers and even smaller battlecruisers to sneak inside and deal damage from within.\
*While not completely a blind spot, there is a significant lack of firepower on the ventral area of the ship near the stern. The lower bow, however, is completely unguarded.\
== Strategy ==\
* Be sure to target ships like the Ampharos, as they can shred your fighters very efficiently, especially considering the Wrath's small health pool.\
* Be very wary of hull-breakers such as the [[Ridgebreaker]] or [[:Category:Hull breaker|other ships similar to it]]. This ship's health pool relies primarily on its hull health.\
\
*You can attempt to fighter [[Fighter Swarming|swarm]], as the fighters are provided in sufficient amounts to effectively assault a target.\
*DON'T let ships warp underneath you. It will likely spell huge damage or even destruction to your ship.\
*Some players use this ship as a nuke... as it has a massive nuke and can one-shot anything under a battleship, and some dreadnoughts.\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled by oChaosWarrioro in .61e4.\
* Health increased to 6250 [[Shields]], 6000 [[Hull]], Top Speed reduced to 29, Turn Speed changed to 0.03, Acceleration changed to 5, and Cargo Hold increased to 1260.\
*Remodeled again in version .64c.\
*Hull increased from 6000 to 10000, loadout changed to 2 [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]], 4 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]] and 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] in version .68d.\
* Hull reduced from 10000 to 7000 in version .69a2.\
*Remodeled by Wiscyy in version (?) and received custom fighters, the '''[[Wrath]]s.'''\
*Remodeled by boom boom boom in version (?) and received new fighters, the '''Typhoons,''' Along with the heath being increased (shield increased from 6500 to 8500, hull increased from 9000 to 10000) and the nuke being \"increase to epic proportions\" (spelling errors kept in order to be faithful to the source material)'''.'''\
*Description updated (.75?)\
== Trivia ==\
* The old '''Stormbringer''' had what seemed to be a large runway on the top. Although it may have been meant to be used for landing, it was rarely used by players other than as a walking platform.\
* The '''Stormbringer's '''original model was nicknamed \"The Shoebox\"\
*The third model and [[Wrath|its fighters]] were only used briefly until they were removed in favour of the current model, likely due to issues like not enough fighters and a lack of a fighter bay teleporter.\

'''Snowflakes''' are once again physical objects just as they were back in 2018 and earlier. These '''Snowflakes''' can be found in [[Mega Base]] and [[Aqueous II]] in certain spawning locations. In order for any '''Snowflakes''' to spawn in a private server, at least 4 people need to be present. Additionally, a minimum of 6 players are required for snowflakes to spawn at Aqueous II.\
\
Snowflakes will respawn at set locations on intervals of 10 to 15 minutes.\
\
Mega Base Spawning Locations:\
\
*Main Lobby inside wall of Gazebo\
*Far end of the Game Contributors hallway\
*Right side behind the curtain of the auditorium on the second floor of terminal B\
*Corner of 2nd floor terminal A\
*Advanced ship Requisition (Terminal D Floor 2) Behind Super Cap Terminals\
\
Aqueous Spawning Locations:\
\
*In the center of the level one base, or outside the pillar of an upgraded base\
*Near the edge of the laser fence on an upgraded base, or near one of the doorways? on a level one base\
*Near another doorway on a level one base, or out in the snow on an upgraded base\
*In a cave near terminals D and E\
\
==2019==\
The source of '''Snowflakes''' for the previous Christmas Event, the [[Christmas Event 2019]], are the [[Aliens]], which have been redesigned for the event. [[Swarmer|Alien Swarmers]] drop 1 Snowflake and [[Punisher|Alien Punishers]] drop 20.\
\
==2018 and Earlier==\
'''Snowflakes''' were previously physical objects found in-game. They were used in the 2017[[The Ice Monster|Ice Monster]] quest to create the [[Blizzard]] and the 2018 Christmas Event to create ships. These neon-blue objects were found at every base except for [[Frion I]] & [[Military HQ]]. They only spawned when a minimum of 6 people were in a server during the [[Christmas Event 2018]] (Public Server or Private Server).\
\
When these were available during the past events, players could obtain one by walking over to where the '''Snowflake''' was and touching it to pick it up. The Snowflakes would then automatically be moved to the player's warehouse.\
\
The '''Snowflakes''' used to spawn in these areas of the [[Mega Base]], [[Starbase]]s, and [[Aqueous II]].\

==Description==\
The '''''Harvest King''''' was a Boss [[:Category:NPC|NPC]] ship added during the [[Halloween Event 2018|2018 Halloween Event]]. It was MUCH more powerful than the infamous [[Grim Reaper]] featured in 2017's Halloween event. It featured powerful [[Turrets]] not found on any other ship called [[Turrets|Harvest Super Lasers]]. It also featured [[Turrets]] with high rates of fire like those found on the [[Alien Harvest Servitor]]s.\
\
The '''Harvest King''' was the primary source of [[Space Pumpkin]]s used to create event [[Ships]], dropping around 30 after being destroyed. The '''Harvest King''' would also drop 1 [[Ghost Pumpkin]] after being destroyed; this particular pumpkin was used in a quest given by the [[Grim Reaper (NPC)]]. The '''explosion''' of the dying '''Harvest King''' could deal a whopping '''2,500+''' damage to ships as far as 4.5k (10k on its final form) studs away. Like with a destroyed [[Mothership]] or [[:Category:Prototype|Prototype]], it was recommended that all [[Ships]] nearby warp away as soon as the explosions start.\
== Alien Harvest Servitors ==\
The '''Harvest King''' arrived in the server with two or three [[Alien Harvest Servitor|Servitors]] alongside it. These ships share the same symbol as [[Aliens|Alien Punishers]], but with an orange coloring instead of light green. They cannot call other Aliens to their location, making soloing them a viable strategy. Most players will attempt to destroy these before engaging the '''Harvest King.'''\
\
Like [[Aliens|Punishers]], [[Alien Harvest Servitor|Servitors]] can occasionally spawn naturally in the server, providing a somewhat steady source of [[Space Pumpkin]]s (2 per ship).\
==Strategies==\
Like regular [[Aliens|Alien Punishers]], the '''Harvest King''' can call all other Aliens in the server to its location. This can create incredibly deadly swarms, which is why many players target the [[Alien Harvest Servitor|Servitors]] or [[Aliens|Punishers]] already spawned.\
\
Use Starbases to your advantage. An incredibly powerful strategy is to lure the '''Harvest King''' to a Level 5 [[Mothership]] and have it distracted by the [[Mothership]] or a small frigate while attacking it. Beware, if it has a powerful enough fleet in the right position (at the aft of [[Mothership]]) the '''Harvest King''' will overpower it, but it will be heavily damaged afterward.\
\
Use the [[Mega Base]]'s SAFE dock:\
\
Lure the '''Harvest King''' to the [[Mega Base]] where a player's ship is docked and the '''Harvest King''' would target it without doing any damage. Then, the rest of the players can safely attack it while the '''Harvest King''' and other [[Aliens]] are distracted.\
\
Another strategy is to let a decently fast enough [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] distract and dodge the lasers of the '''Harvest King''' while a more powerful fleet moves in to destroy the '''Harvest King'''. However, the '''Harvest King''' has about 350 speed, so it is advisable to use a [[Draco]] or a [[Viper]]. It is advised never to fly in a straight line, as it is possible for the '''Harvest King''' to catch up to you and finish you off with its incredible spinal aim. As the [[Viper]]/[[Draco]], it's best to fly in circles where there is a rare chance of the '''Harvest King''' landing a hit on you. Remember '''never''' to go too close.\
\
Ever since the '''Harvest King''' reached its final form, ships like the [[Draco]] or the [[Dragon]] have become too slow, thus making them unsuitable to outrun the King.\
== Stage III/Final Form ==\
On October 30, the '''Harvest King''' reached Stage III of its evolution, or its final form, at which the firepower of its [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]] increased further. It became faster than ships like the [[Viper]], so if you were trying to lure it, you had to warp constantly in the direction you were going so you didn't get outrun by it.\
\
It also changed in design - the red neon parts changed to a pink color, and the \"fins\" changed color from red to gold.\
\
Once it had reached its final form, the '''Harvest King '''dropped 1 [[Ghost Pumpkin]] and 25 [[Space Pumpkin]]s once killed. It's explosion damage was increased so drastically that it was capable of destroying a level 3 [[Starbase]] upon death, and its explosion radius had been increased from 6k to 10k studs.\
==Trivia==\
* The name \"Harvest King\" likely comes from the association of Halloween with the harvest season.\
* The '''Harvest King''' was made by lightning9160, under the name \"Judicator\".\
* The '''Harvest King''' grew powerful after achieving Stage III in its final evolution, while the [[Alien Harvest Servitor|Harvest Servitors]] weakened from the King's evolution.\
* The '''Harvest King''' had a grand total of 18 turrets, whereas the turret cap for obtainable ships is 10. Due to this, and having an extremely overpowered armament, it is able to destroy a full hp archeon in 2 salvos.  \
*A video of a '''Harvest King''' battle taken by Glowstone_Guy can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2qiYO0rbec\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Sentaliz''' is a [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] ship mostly used in swarms to kill large ships. As a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]], the '''Sentaliz''' is lacking in overall integrity but is able to compensate this with its extreme mobility and powerful [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]]. \
== Appearance ==\
The interior of this ship is quite simple, with a blue metal pilot's seat and a 3D display with three yellow projectors. It is entered by jumping through the cockpit roof into a seat.\
== Advantages ==\
* Very high hull damage output.\
* Very small, similar to a large [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] in size.\
* Flat design makes it harder to hit. \
* Excellent maneuverability for a ship of its class.\
* Small Torpedoes have a long range of 9k, allowing it to outrange [[Starbase]]s and engage enemy ships from a long distance.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Minimal [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower; the turrets are barely any good even against the weakest ships.\
* Lowest total health in its class, excluding the [[Stealth B-2]] and [[Stealth One]].\
* Weak to shield breakers, due to most of its health being shields.\
* Requires the [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP Gamepass]] to build.\
== Strategy ==\
* This ship is incredibly effective at taking on other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], as its high mobility allows it to get in blind spots and avoid heavy turrets while using the [[Spinals|Small Torpedoes]] to deal massive damage.\
* Be careful of any ships such as the [[Leviathan]] or [[Tempest]] that have high firepower and decent mobility, as they can match your dog fighting toe-toe.\
* Use your speed to your advantage. Larger ships like the [[Apocalypse]] or [[Behemoth]] can't turn to match you.\
* Always position yourself in a ship's blind spot and unleash your [[Spinals|Spinal]] fury!\
* Try grouping up with other '''Sentaliz''' or spinal-based [[Ships]], as your combined strength is enough to take down any [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] in seconds.\
* Use range to your advantage. Your 6 [[Spinals|Small Torpedoes]] combined, with your 185 speed will allow you to finish off large targets.\
* When diving, it is advisable to stay at 6000 range in order to dodge heavy weapons while finishing off hulled targets.\
* Watch out for small ships, as the [[Viper]] and [[Draco]], as they have the ability to dodge your PDLs.\
* Combining the speed and the [[Spinals|Small Torpedoes]], this ship proves to be effective at supporting [[Sieging|Sieges]] on Starbases and Planets.\
== Version history ==\
* At one point<span> the two turrets (1 [[Turrets|Light Laser]] and 1 [[Turrets|Light Flak]]) were removed as the ship was too overpowered, but they were added back, then replaced by two [[Turrets|Light Gatling Cannons]].</span>\
* The original arsenal was 2 [[Spinals|Large Phasers]], 4 [[Spinals|Large Cannons]], and a [[Turrets|Light Laser]], but it was changed for being too powerful.\
* Received a remodel in .60.\
* Received a price change in an unknown version, decreasing its cost.\
* Changed in .63h to have 200 more health in each stat, speed decreased from 150 to 135, and price increased somewhat.\
* Top Speed increased from 135 to 145 in .65b\
* Buffed in .66b, increasing its shield from 2600 to 2950, its top speed from 145 to 155, and its turnspeed from 0.5 to 0.55,\
* Top speed reduced from 155 to 145, turn speed reduced from 0.55 to 0.5, acceleration reduced from 24 to 20, 2 [[Spinals|Large Cannons]] replaced with 4 [[Spinals|Small Torpedoes]] and received a remodel in version .69a2. The former 3 changes didn't had any further notice, unlike the latter 2.\
* 2 [[Spinals|Large Phasers]] removed in version .69a2.\
*Custom max drift now 70% .75a12\
*Explosion Size 40 ----> 265 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Sentaliz''', although being one of the more expensive [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], is also the smallest [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] in-game.\
* Unlike most other ships, the '''Sentaliz''' has a unique appearance in that its wing pieces are not directly attached to the main body of the ship.\
* The second battleship to be [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]], the first being the [[Carvainir]].\
* Has similar features to the [[Aeaphiel]], which shares a common designer.\
* It used to be very good at taking out [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], but various nerfs made it much more dangerous to take on [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] without being a skilled pilot or being in a group of multiple '''Sentaliz'''. It is now used more often to combat [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] or large [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]].\
* The [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] rebalance more or less reverted the '''Sentaliz '''nerf, making it somewhat viable to take on [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] again.\
* It has a yellow trail when moving.\
* It is built by [[Xeiron Industries]], as the wings have \"Xeiron\" written on them.\
* Has a limited remodel, the [[Santaliz]].\

"Nuking","{{Outdated}}\
If you haven't already seen the summary of this strategy on the [[Strategies]] page, please click [[Strategies#Nuking|here]]. In short: '''Nuking''' is the act of purposefully using ships with high explosion values to destroy the ship, and to use the nuke upon ship explosion to try to take other ships with you.\
===Nuking Damage Mechanics===\
Currently, nuke damage works as stated below:\
(Excerpt from Update Log channel in Galaxy Official Discord:)\"--Nuke Changes\
1) Resistance now applies to nukes.\
2) Max nuke damage (0% resistance) is Radius x 4. (WAS Radius x 2 tho ignored resistance)\
3) Shield takes 50% nuke damage\
4) Bases take 50% nuke damage\
5) Nuke damage is also proportional to range (e.g. 2k range, if 1k out will recieve 50% of the damage)\
6) ALL Base Nukes Deal extra 2x nuke damage (Nuke radius x 8 = max damage)\"\
The information below was sourced from a Galaxy Developer ([[User:Wingy|yname]]):\
\
ai (alien, pirate, etc.) = 15% shield, 40% hull\
\
base (starbase, mothership, etc.) = 60% shield, 100% hull\
\
other (players) = 50% shield, 90% hull\
\
If you didn't understand this all the above information, an explanation may help(the explosion of a base or ship upon destruction will be referred to as \"nuke\" from this point onward on this page): A [[Starbase|base]]'s or [[Ships|ship]]'s damage resistance(dependent on its class), object type(AI (NPC)Ship, Base/Planet, Player ship), Shields, range at which the nuke did damage to a ship/base/planet, the explosion value of the ship or base that the nuke originated from, if the object taking damage is a base, and if the nuke originated from a base are all factors of how nuke damage is calculated. Let's start with an example, like the [[Nyx]]. It's explosion value is 1250: The explosion value of a ship or base determines its explosion radius size, displayed as a scaled down value by a factor of 9(i.e. an Explosion Value[Listed as \"Explosion Radius\" in the :shipinfo command] translates to an explosion radius of 11,250 studs). The damage that a nuke does is calculated by how large the explosion radius is, with the value multiplied by 4(i.e. Nyx's nuke has a base damage of 50,000 HP[12,500×4=50,000]). Nuke damage also scales with distance. Say that the Nyx's nuke damaged a [[Nemesis]] from 6,250 studs away. The nuke would do exactly half of the damage(25,000), and that's not even having accounted for additional resistances; such as Class resistance(which in the case of [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] is 50%), and [[Shields]](Shield health on ships and bases have an additional 50% resistance to nuke damage). In which case, the total damage that the Nemesis receives if it tanked the nuke at full health would be 6,250 damage(which is in excess of its total shield health, so we're gonna have to do conversion here[6,250-5650=600,600÷0.5 <Note:This is because the damage resistance of dreadnoughts is 50%, still have to account for that> = 1,200 --> 1,200×0.9 <Nukes only deal 90% of their damage to the hull of player ships> = 1,080]), which results in the Nemesis being left on only 4,920 [[Hull]] health. Pretty nasty damage. Anyways, now that you (probably) have a decent understanding of how nuke damage is calculated, let's go over where nukes are most effective. <span style=\"color:yellow\">'''Note: This section is outdated. The maximum damage of a nuke is 69-times the value of the explosion radius (i.e. explosion radius value of 1000 has a maximum damage of 69,000). Additionally, instant explosions (which currently are unable to occur) cause the maximum damage of a nuke to be multiplied by 1.2 (i.e. 69,000 maximum damage is increased to 82,800 if it is an instant explosion). The section below is possibly also outdated for the same reason, please take the information on this page with a grain of salt. See the image below for reference:'''</span>\
[[File:NukeDmgConfig.png|center|Image of configuration settings for explosions in an in-game script by yname]]\
===Nuking Effectively ===\
For starters, nuking bases is a bad idea. On top of them having decently high resistance to damage, they also have an extra 50% resistance against nuke damage. Throwing Nyx nukes at a level 5 [[Starbase]] even from point blank makes it take a very long time to destroy it with nukes alone(would take 4 point-blank Nyx nukes to just destroy the shield!). Likewise, base nukes are dangerous because they do twice the damage of ship nukes(Explosion Radius×8). For example, a level 5 [[Mothership]] nuke comes out to an astonishing total damage of 114,320 base damage(14,290×8=114,320). Even tanking the nuke from half of the maximum distance is enough to kill any Dreadnought in the game instantly regardless of being full health; it is only [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]], and durable [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] that are able to tank the nuke from half of the maximum range. With that out of the way, here are a few points about nuking:\
*'''Only nuke as a last resort if you know your ship is going to be destroyed.''' Nuking is no-where near cost-effective in most cases, and it is very expensive to do it at a scale where it is dangerous to other [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]].\
*[[Warp Drive|Warp]] away from large size nukes, '''especially [[Starbase|Base]] nukes''', as they do a lot of damage.\
*If you find a crippled capital ship trying to limp back home and it's obvious that the pilot isn't paying much attention to their surroundings, you can try to nuke them using a cheap throw-away nuke like the [[M Class]]. However, it's more effective to use a combat ship [[Category:Hull breaker|ship with a focus on kinetic armament]] <nowiki> </nowiki>to destroy said crippled ship in most cases.\
==Version History==\
*Explosion radius size was changed from explosion radius value × 10, to explosion radius value × 9 (i.e. a value of 1000 for explosion radius has 9000 range now, not 10,000) in an unknown version.\
==Trivia ==\
*Mothership nukes have a notorious reputation for destroying the ships of unfortunate victims who were either not paying attention or failed to warp out in time.\

==Description==\
The '''Vanguard''' is a very compact [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] and the smallest in the game. It has low [[Turrets|Turret]] and [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] firepower and is commonly used as a support [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]]. The outside appears very armored, but it has rather low health for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]]-class ship.\
\
This [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] contains 3 [[Falcon]]s.\
==Interior==\
When you enter the ship through the right hangar, there will be a command room to the right. Inside the command room, there is a pilot seat and some control panels.\
==Advantages==\
*Smaller than some other [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]], about the size of the average [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]; if not a little smaller, but with decent speed, making it more difficult to hit.\
*Powerful [[Spinals]].\
*Durable [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Very fast Turn Speed for a carrier, as maneuverable as many of the more agile [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] in the game.\
*Fastest [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] in the game, being faster than some [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]], and faster than over half of the build menu [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] in the game.\
*Relatively cheap to equip all fighters with AI pilots, only costing 500 robux since anyone who buys this will have VIP which gives you a free AI fighter.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Only has 3 Falcons.\
*Low [[Shields|Shield]] damage without using its [[Spinals]].\
*If carriers with a better fighter fleet are available, use of this ship is impractical as there is only one Carrier slot per team.\
* Large blind-spot below the ship.\
*Spinals can be hard to aim due to the large gap between the position of the two spinals.\
*Bad health for a Carrier.\
*Underwhelming damage output, even with all Fighters.\
*Very expensive compared to many cheaper, more effective Carriers.\
==Strategy==\
*A very powerful ship for killing [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] or [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] with since you can deploy the Y.Falcons to distract the [[Starbase]] and destroy other [[ships]] while the base is distracted.\
* Do not use the '''Vanguard''' in a siege unless no one else has a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]], as only one is allowed per faction.\
*Use the Falcons the way you would use a [[Viper]] while [[Sieging]] since they are tanky but have a weak armament.\
==Version History==\
*Received a price decrease in version .61g.\
*Received a speed buff in version .62d2\
*Received a remodel in version .65b.\
*Health increased from 1800/1600 to 4000/3500 in version .68d.\
* Removed from the build menu because of a broken model in version .71a1.\
*On sale again after version .72f\
*Shields reduced from 4000 to 3600 and hull increased from 3500 to 4800 in version .72f1 (this buff was revealed in-game).\
*Shields increased from 3600 to 6500, Top Speed reduced from 120 to 70, Acceleration increased from 15 to 35, Turn Speed reduced from 0.4 to 0.35, turret loadout changed from 3 Light Gatling Cannons, 1 Light Gatling Laser, 2 Medium Flak Cannons to 6 Triple Heavy Cannons, and 2 Dual Medium Lasers, Spinal loadout changed from 8 Medium Phasers and 6 Medium Cannons to 4 Medium spinals for phasers and cannons respectively, fighters changed from 2 [[Falcon]]s to 3 [[Y.Falcons]], Cargo Hold increased from 70 to 250, and remodeled in version .74b14.\
*Y.Falcons renamed to Falcon<sup>(When?)</sup>.\
*Top speed increased from 75 to 120, turn speed adjusted to 0.3<sup>(previous value is uncertain due to outdated information, please add)</sup>, 4 Medium Phasers changed to 2 Large Phasers and interval removed, 4 Medium Cannons upsized to Large, and Health changed from 6500 Shields and 4800 Hull to 5500 Shields and 5000 Hull in version .75a5.\
==Trivia==\
*The smallest [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] in Galaxy (disputed, the ship has undergone a remodel and now has a similar size factor to the [[Stormbringer|Stormbringer's]] current model).\
*\
*The only [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] in the game that spawns [[Falcon]]s.\
*The [[Sakala]] uses the same description as the '''Vanguard'''.\
*<s>The model is currently broken, so that the fighters spawn too high and are hard to enter.</s> The model was fixed in a recent update when the Vanguard was re-released into the game.\
*Many people are upset about the recent overhaul, preferring the old version due to the speed, small size, and amazing DPS along with good health and damage resistance. Now the '''Vanguard''' is considered a mediocre carrier due to the high cost, low health, and underwhelming power.\

== Description ==\
The '''Nemesis''' is a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]-class ship designed for multi-purpose use. With its large variety of weaponry and very high damage output, it is a great all-rounder Dreadnought, performing well in both ship-to-ship combat and [[Starbase]] sieges. It is recommended for players who can aim [[Spinals|Spinal]] weapons well, as they are crucial to winning ship-to-ship battles. Overall, this is a great ship for experienced players.\
== Appearance ==\
===New Interior===\
You enter the ship through a teleporter that takes you to a staircase. Go up the staircase, behind you is the captain's chair and in front of you is a picture of the ship's creator, Pleeber.\
=== Old-ish Interior ===\
The current interior is still in its unfinished state. As it is currently, the exterior teleporter is now located on the rear right engine. This teleporter takes players to a moderately sized room with moderate detail. The room has detailed walls and a large square in the center that serves as the pilot's seat. There is nothing else to the interior currently that players can access, but if you rotate the camera through the hull of the ship while sitting in the pilot's seat you can see the beginnings of a small meeting room and stairs leading down to it, however, there is currently no way to get to this area.\
=== Old Interior ===\
There are two ways to enter the ship. The first is by using the teleporter, which takes a player straight to the bridge. If the player chooses to go through the door just past the teleporter, they will enter a hallway that branches directly to the left and right. Both sides of the hallway lead to a balcony overlooking a large table with lordmoneymonkey's roblox character decal on it and surrounded by seats. The balconies converge at the other side of the room at a staircase leading down to the meeting room. Just before the staircase, there is an airlock on either side that enters the bridge.\
\
The bridge is a highly decorated room with an elevated captain's chair at the center. At the back of the room, between the two airlocks, is a teleporter that leads back out to between the engines.\
== Advantages ==\
* Variety of [[Turrets]].\
* Powerful [[Spinals]].\
* All Turrets have a good line of sight.\
* Highly Balanced\
* A great all-around ship.\
* High damage output.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Not as effective in team fights as other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], but works great for other roles.\
* Requires good aim with Spinals.\
* Large blindspot on the rear and under of the ship.\
* Weak Spinals compared to other Dreadnoughts.\
== Strategy ==\
* The Nemesis is a good choice for PvP, as it has good acceleration and powerful Turrets that allow it to quickly enter into a stern chase or destroy a target that is above it.\
* Attack targets from below while pointed at them to maximize the turret line of sight and spinal positioning.\
* Never let any ships with high mobility, such as the [[Black Flare]], etc. get under you. They will most likely stay under you and will be able to shoot you with you not being able to defend.\
== Version History ==\
* Remodeled in .61h1.\
* Max [[Hull]] increased from 4500 to 5500, Max [[Shields|Shield]] increased from 5600 to 5650 in version .65b.\
* Max Hull buffed from 5500 to 6000 in version .66b.\
* All [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] and [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] switched to [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] and [[Turrets|Capital Lasers]].\
* Max Cargo Hold nerfed from 1600 to 312 in version .67b.\
* Temporarily given its previous model in version .68e.\
* Teleporters from the pilot's seat to the docking point made visible in version .68e.\
* 2 [[Turrets|Capital Triple Lasers]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] and 6 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] changed to 6 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] in version .69a1.\
* Remodeled in an unknown version.\
*Explosion Size 174 ----> 620 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* The '''Nemesis''' was one of the ships to be chosen for the [[:Category:Halloween 2017|2017 Halloween Event]]. Its remodel is known as the [[Frankenemi]], which still currently retains the Nemesis's original interior.\
* The ship's 3rd model took [[Galaxy Staff|Lordmoneymonkey]] 21 hours to build.\
* Occasionally used by faction leaders as a place to have faction meetings.\
* Used to have the most detailed interior of any ship.\

The '''''Leviathan''''' is a '''[[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]''' class ship, the first of its kind to be added to Galaxy.\
\
== Description ==\
The once (and still) infamous '''Leviathan''' features a sleek design and excellent PvP capabilities to boot.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Leviathan''' is a small room containing little more than the pilot's seat and the teleporter leading in and out.\
== Advantages ==\
* Fantastic at PvP against [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
* Large variety of well-placed [[Turrets]].\
* High [[Hull]] damage. Excels at countering the [[Slipstream]] and [[Armageddon]] as well as finishing off crippled Capital Ships.\
* Very fast and maneuverable for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], only slower than the [[Slipstream]], [[SR-71]], and its limited [[Cyber Leviathan]] and [[Retro Leviathan]] counterparts. \
*Much better at exploiting weak spots than most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Mediocre [[Sieging]] capabilities.\
* Smaller [[Ships]] are a huge nuisance if the pilot isn't highly skilled or backed up by their team.\
* Only 2 [[Turrets]] on the underbelly, creating a weak spot which small ships can (and most definitely will) exploit.\
*Lesser Cargo Hold for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
* Somewhat expensive, at 252,444 credits.\
*Although good for PvP, stay away from other PvP ships like the [[Andromeda]] as it's superior firepower can easily tear you apart despite it being more fragile.\
== Strategy ==\
* The '''Leviathan''' is an excellent [[:Category:PVP Ship|PVP Ship]]. The [[Turrets|Turret]] layout and maneuverability make it difficult for other large ships to stay behind you, so use this as an advantage against other opposing ships.\
* Its Maneuverability is best used for countering larger ships like [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and slow [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
* Use your quick turn speed and speed to your advantage to make sure ships do not go under you.\
* Do not waste your spinals, more than half of your hull DPS comes from them.\
\
== Version History==\
*The '''Leviathan''' received a remodel and a buff in .58c, affecting its firepower, mobility, and a massive price change.\
*Triple Heavy Cannon replaced with Rapid Fire Cannon and another price change in version .66b\
*Rapid Fire Cannon, Heavy Lasers switched to Capital Cannons/Capital Lasers & Triple Heavy Cannons.\
*Remodeled in version .66b. Top speed increased to 65, Shield increased to 5500-5750 and Hull to 5000–5350.\
*Received another remodel in version .68d.\
*Top Speed increased to 75, Acceleration increased to 15, 2 [[Turrets|Capital Triple Lasers]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]], 4 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] changed to 4 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Lasers]] in version .69a1.\
*[[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Cannon]] spinal count increased from 2 to 3, 1 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannon]] changed to 1 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Laser]], 2 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Lasers]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Triple Medium Lasers]] in version .73b8.\
*[[Turrets|Dual Medium Lasers]] replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]], 1 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Laser]] switched to [[Turrets|SR PDL]], added 1 [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Cannon]] [[Spinal Weaponry|spinal]] (total: 4), speed buffed to 85, acceleration & turnspeed buffed to 20 & 0.2 respectively, and Cargo Hold increased to 250 in version .75a\
*Explosion Size 500 ----> 600 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* In etymology, the Leviathan got its name from the sea monster in the scriptural accounts of Yahweh, where in the accounts it was defeated by him.\
* It was '''the very first [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]''' to be added to Galaxy, entering with a '''Top Speed of 120''', '''5250 [[Shields|Shield]] health''' and '''4500 [[Hull]] health'''.\
* The Leviathan is '''commonly seen''' on [[Galaxy Arcade]] as it is the cheapest '''Dreadnought''' bought with Robux (after VIP Dreadnoughts).\
\
* This ship's model used to be broken due to meshing issues.\
* The only [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] faster than it as of now are the [[Slipstream]], the [[Liberator]], the [[SR-71]], and its limited [[Cyber Leviathan]] and [[Retro Leviathan]] counterparts.\
* Inside the cockpit of the Leviathan, it's possible to jump out of the top of the back.\
* The original [[Prototype X-1]] model was initially going to be a Leviathan remodel.\
*This ship is the most remodeled [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\

The '''''Blizzard''''' is a powerful [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] that was introduced in the [[Christmas Event 2017]], but was re-introduced in the [[Christmas Event 2022|<span style=\"color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;\">Christmas Event 2022</span>]].\
==Description==\
The Blizzard is an extremely large [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] that carries 4 Unique [[IceFyre]] Fighters.\
\
This Ship excels at being a flagship in a fleet due to it's health, firepower, and speed, and the diversity of [[Turrets]] it has, having extremely high turret firepower for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
==Appearance==\
The Blizzard is one of the largest and widest ships in the game, even bigger than some [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships.]] and dwarfing every other [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] in size. \
\
The Ship has a futuristic, snow theme with many, many complex detailings around it. On its back has a large amount of engines, along with 2 extremely large fins around its side, supporting the ship. On the sides can be seen the 2 Hangars with each carrying 2 [[IceFyre]] fighters. On the front has its signature yellow ball, which was a reference to its previous model.\
\
Its interior sports a large room with many icy decorations like icicles on its ceiling. There are 3 Seats, with the middle being the pilot seat.\
==Advantages==\
*Large health pool.\
*Despite it's size, it is fast with a top speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.top_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Blizzard'}}\
*Has very high firepower for a carrier, allowing it to destroy other large [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]] even without the assistance of its fighters.\
*Can support itself very well even without its Fighters.\
*Has long range turrets with a range of up to 6800.\
*Fighters can shred shields from their spinals.\
*Great for supporting fleets with its high health and large firepower.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Large [[Galaxy Terminology|Blindspots]] underneath and on the back of the ship.\
*Extremely Large, making it very easy to hit with spinals and any turrets.\
*Struggles to fire all turrets at once, unless pointing directly at its target.\
*Limited carrier, making you a large target.\
==Strategy== \
*Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.\
*When fighting with the Blizzard, try and stay pointed to your opponent so all your turrets have a line of sight.\
*If you have to fight, stay below and pointed at the enemy so majority of your turrets can fire, and take down [[Galaxy Slang|AA]] Ships with your turret firepower like the [[Ampharos]] and [[Hyron]] which can shred your [[IceFyre|Fighters]].\
*Beware of swarms of small [[Ships]] that can overwhelm the Blizzard.\
==Version History==\
* The ship was renamed due to the quest being broken.\
* Received a remodel in .61e.\
*Received several changes in .65b. including a health buff that buffed [[Shields|Shield]] from 2500 to 3750, and Hull from 2000 to 4500. Its Flak Cannons were replaced with Dual Cannons. The fighters replaced with [[IceFyre]]s.\
*Cannons reverted to Flak Cannons in version .65b.\
*Health increased from 3750/4500 to 8000/5000 in version .68d.\
*Hull increased to 9000, turret loadout changed to 2 Frosty Flak Cannons, 2 Frosty Dual Medium Lasers, 2 Frosty Dual Medium Cannons, 2 Frosty Triple Heavy Cannons and 1 Frosty Triple Heavy Laser in an unknown version (only revealed in-game).\
*Complete Remodel and Overhaul of the entire ship in version .75a37.\
==Trivia==\
* This was the first [[Christmas Event 2017]] limited ship.\
*Was the only carrier to exclusively have [[Dragonfly|Dragonflies]].\
*The '''Blizzard''' was originally named the Snowstorm, but the name was changed.\
*Due to the name of the ship being changed, the error message \"This model is too big for Roblox to handle\" was displayed as a placeholder. This has since been fixed.\
*Many players sold the '''Blizzard''' to gain more [[Credits]]; however, most of them didn't realize that it was gone until the [[Christmas Event 2022|<span style=\"color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;\">Christmas Event 2022</span>]].\
* The second holiday-themed event ship that was obtained through a quest, the first being the [[Reaper]].\
*The second event Carrier, the first being the [[Ghoul Nyx]].\
*Funny enough, back in the days when this was available, the ship was deemed weak and so it was sold by a lot of the people who got it back then, for about 40k.\
* The remodeled version has an orb at the front of the ship, similar to the [[Vansnova]], [[Reaper]], and the [[Grim]].\
*The original '''Blizzard''' model was meant to be a [[Revelation]] remodel made by ARiNA.\
*The original model resembles the Damocles from Rebel Galaxy.\

\
==Description==\
The '''Lazarus''' is a '''[[Ships|Ship]]''' with an astounding [[Shields|Shield]] health and a very balanced firepower. While not being one of the most maneuverable '''[[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]''', it can still inflict a great deal of damage to ships of the same size or bigger thanks to its powerful [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal Phasers]] and [[Turrets|Kinetic turrets]]. Due to the lack of [[Hull]], it can be heavily countered by shield-breakers.\
==Interior==\
The interior of the '''Lazarus''' is a small, very dark room containing only the pilot's seat and teleporter, and is entered via the teleporter on the back tip of the ship.\
==Advantages==\
*Overall high DPS towards both [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]], focusing mainly toward the former.\
*Triple [[Turrets]] have a fast fire rate, making it a little easier to fight smaller ships.\
*Can easily shred [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], Carriers, and even Bosses with low support.\
*Very high shield health, great for countering hull-breakers such as [[Ridgebreaker]] and [[Avalon]].\
*[[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] fire from one point and all at once, making it easy to hit all the individual shots.\
*Great DPS if you can use your [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]], especially against easier-to-hit bosses.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Difficult to get full line of sight with the [[turrets]], requiring careful angling and frequent repositioning even for larger moving targets.\
*Lacks [[Shields|Shield]] damage without the use of its [[Spinals]].\
*Lowest [[Hull]] health of its class.\
*Multiple blind spots, most notably on the back and below.\
*Shield breakers such as the [[Zeus]] and [[Sagittarius]] will shred almost all of its health pool.\
*Sluggish speed and maneuverability.\
==Strategy == \
*The '''Lazarus's''' great DPS and immense [[shields]] makes it excellent for running into an existing battle or diving a [[Starbase|base]] then escaping without the enemy knowing if you are low on health or not.\
*Deciding to escape battles with a few thousand shields is recommended to avoid being hulled. Players will certainly chase down a hulled '''Lazarus'''.\
* Treat your shield health as if it were the entire health pool, because it pretty much is. Consider half-shields to be the equivalent of \"hulled\" and you will live through many more tough encounters.\
*Avoid shield shredders like the [[Zeus]] or [[Sagittarius]] as they can severely damage or even kill a '''Lazarus''' with ease.\
*Be careful around [[Aliens]], especially [[Punisher]] and [[Decimator]] as their high shield damage can tear you apart. An unsupported Punisher can be face-tanked, but if a Decimator targets you, retreat.\
*Try not to let enemy ships get under you, as you there are no [[turrets]] on the underside of the ship.\
==Version History== \
*Made a [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] ship a few days after its release in .62a1. This change also buffed the Shield from 8240 to 8500 and nerfed the Hull from 3850 to 1250.\
*[[Shields|Shield]] increased to 9001 (from 8500), turn speed increased to 0.07 (from 0.05) in .65b\
*Received buff by replacing its [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] and [[Turrets|Lasers]] with 2x Rapid Fire Lasers and 3x Rapid Fire Cannons in the \"Mega update\".\
*Turn speed increased from 0.07 to 0.1 in version .66b\
*Shield and Hull health increased from 9001 to 11050 and 1250 to 2000 respectively in version .68e.\
*3 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] changed to 3 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] in version .69a1.\
*[[Spinal Weaponry|Medium Phaser]] firing interval reduced to 0 and received a remodel in version .70c.\
*Shields buffed to 12050 in an unknown version (only revealed in-game). <sup>('''What version?''')</sup>\
*Turret placement changed to improve line of sight in unknown version.\
*Lost 1 [[Turrets|Capital Triple Cannon]] and given a G [[Spinal Weaponry|spinal]] of 4 medium cannons in version .74a.\
*Major nerf of shields, decreasing from 12500 to 10000 in version .75a.\
*Explosion Size 200 ----> 760 .75a12\
*Phasers 10 ----> 6  2x Capital Triple Laser ----> 2x Heavy Laser .75a20\
==Trivia==\
*Previously well known for having the highest DPS of all build menu [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], however multiple other ships of its class have gotten higher DPS since then.\
*The '''Lazarus''' currently has the second weakest hull health value for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought-Class]] ship, only higher than the [[SR-71]].\
*Frequently called 'Laz' for short.\
*The '''Lazarus'''' previous model had some major meshing issues, which are displayed below.\
*The '''Lazarus''' previous shield health of 9001 was a reference to the \"over 9000\" meme.\
*Like with the [[Sentaliz]] speed nerf, acceleration nerf and turn speed nerf in version .69a2, the hull increase that occurred in version .68e was not mentioned by any developer, but it's hull buff was revealed in-game.[[File:LazarusMeshBad.png|thumb|220x220px]]\

<h1>Trading Overview</h1>\
<h6>''See the [[Money Making]] page for more strategies on gaining credits''</h6>\
'''''Trading''''' is one of the ways to make money in Galaxy. It involves buying [[Materials]] for cheap prices then selling them for more than the original price. Typically, '''Trading''' is considered to be a step above [[Mining]], as it is less tedious and more profitable. However, to be able to trade, there must be enough mined material to sell. Most of the time, [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] are the ships used to trade.\
\
<div class=\"TDiv shadowhover\">\
<h1 class=\"mw-customtoggle-ProfitsRisks shipclass\">Profits and Risks</h1>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-ProfitsRisks\" align=\"left\">\
\
Different profits can be made for trading. Often people will buy whichever material that has the largest gap between the buy and sell prices, however, if gaps are the same, people will try to get less massive/cheaper materials to maximize profit.\
\
A good tip for any [[Factions|Faction]] that wishes to trade, is to take [[Frion I]] as their own, or ally with whoever owns it. This will not only give them the strongest [[Starbase]] on the server but also give the faction access to cheaper materials, as Frion sells materials for reduced costs.\
\
There are two main risks when trading.\
# To make a big profit you will usually use freighters. Freighters are expensive and have no defense.\
# Usually to make a profit you have to fill up your cargo hold all the way. The bigger cargo hold, the more money you spend filing it up. If you are destroyed/lose connection the money you spent on the cargo will be lost.\

<h1 class=\"mw-customtoggle-TipsTricks shipclass\">Tips, Tricks, and Guides</h1>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-TipsTricks\" align=\"left\">\
Some tips/Tricks of trading are:\
# Don't trade during war.\
# Mining a single ore and dumping it at your base will lower the price.\
# Check your minimap for aliens/pirates if you do trade during war.\
# People can sometimes declare war on you if they notice you are trading.\
# Locking your starbase so people can't buy/sell can a good idea to slowly bring it down if there are people who are trading at your base.\
# allying with large or powerful groups is a good idea.\

<h3>'''Guide'''</h3>\

This is a quick guide to help with trading and these are the profits based on buying a full load of any material in a Freighter and selling it at the [[Mega Base|Mega Base]].\

The following is a list of profits based on the full hold of a [[Prepravca]], [[Wyrm]].\
\
Profit = ( Cargo Hold ÷ Refined Ore Mass ) x ( Mega Base's Price - Star Base's Price )\
\
'''Note''': These are mostly the common prices but you occasionally get those weird prices or very low prices.\
\
Silicate has a profit of 5000, 500 when the price is 4. (Not Common/Rare)\

'''''Item Trading''''', as its name suggests, is a system of exchanging items players have in their [[Warehouse]]s. '''Though there are currently no official rules specifically addressing scamming, those that are caught will be put on a \"known scammer\" list on the [[Official Galaxy Discord Servers|Galaxy Wikia Discord]].'''\
\
To begin an '''Item Trade''', players must:\
# Ask in the chat for an item(s) you want and set a decent price for it. Wait for someone to accept the trade request. (Likes the item the other player proposes and would trade the item the other player wants).\
# If the trade request is accepted, both players must dock a ship with a decent Cargo Hold, generally a [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] at the [[Mega Base]], so it can transfer items from the player's Warehouse to the ship. Other ways of trading items include killing a [[Wyrm]] which holds the material, but this is risky since others can take the loot.\
# If both players are ready, they must Warp to a Starbase that has enough money to buy the traded items. ('''Not''' the [[Mega Base]], since it's linked across all servers and players can steal the items.) If there are other people at the starbase with docked ships, they can steal the items, so it's better to go to an NPC or Alien starbase to trade the items since nobody docks there.*\
# Once the desired items are in each player's Cargo Hold, both players must Warp back to the [[Mega Base]], at which they must transfer their items to their [[Warehouse]]s.*\
# Repeat previous steps if necessary.*\
\
<nowiki>*</nowiki>At these steps, both players must watch out for [[Aliens]] and [[Pirating|Pirates]]. In case if the player's faction is at [[War]], [[Pirating|Pirates]] can destroy and steal the loot of the ships, and with it the items you were trading. Trading can cause you to lose money if you lose connection.\

The '''''Freedom Galaxy''''' is a massive, expensive [[:Category:Miner|'''Miner''']] released during the [[Fourth of July Event 2020]].\
\
==Description==\
The '''Freedom Galaxy '''is the largest, fastest, and the only [[:Category:Miner|Miner]]-class ship in the game with 5 [[Turrets|Large Patriotic Mining Lasers]].  It is also the one of the most expensive ships in the game.\
== Interior==\
The Freedom Galaxy is a reskin of the [[Galaxy]], with American themed color palette, various U.S Flags around the ship, and a different trail color.\
\
The Interior of the Freedom Galaxy can be accessed via a teleporter on the docking ramp like the normal [[Galaxy]]. This will take players to a small room with three chairs. On the walls are depictions of the Sickle and Hammer with a slash through them. The center pilot's seat faces three screens. There are 2 more seats on each side of the walls, with numerous displays on them.\
==Advantages==\
*Has the most health out of all [[:Category:Miner|Miners]], and with extreme maneuverability, this allows players to easily escape pirates before being destroyed.\
*Has the highest mining rate and farthest mining range with its 5 [[Turrets|Large Patriotic Mining]] Lasers. (87.5 m<sup>3</sup>/s)\
*Has the largest Ore Hold in the game.\
*Can make 14k Credits without Loyalty per dump.\
*Amazing miner to use for [[Money Making|Boom mining]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*Huge and bulky making it an easy target.\
*Limited classification and expense means players and entire factions will target you.\
*The Mother of all miner kills. One of the largest targets in the game. Hunted by pirates with more ferocity than any other non-combat ship, and even players in your own faction by dock-blocking you.\
*<u>'''Extremely'''</u> expensive to obtain due to the Class A Permit and high value of the ship, making this one of the most expensive ships in the game.\
==Strategy==\
*TL;DR: You see people? Run.\
*It is always '''never''' a good idea to use this ship in a [[War]]. \
*Trust few.\
* If you are mining in a '''Freedom Galaxy''' and you get ambushed by combat [[Ships]] or [[Aliens]], your best bet would be to quickly get back to your [[Starbase]] and despawn.\
*Do not use this as a nuke or a tank; It is limited and massively expensive due to the sheer cost of the Class A Permit.\
*If large amounts of high-score players joins an enemy team, it's your best bet to dock and despawn before they go on a killing rampage targeting your '''Freedom Galaxy.'''\
*Use this ship with extreme caution. Once it's destroyed, it will be '''extremely''' difficult to reobtain because of the sheer exorbitant cost.\
==Version History==\
*Buffed in version .68b adding another Large Patriotic Mining Laser (60 m3/s>75 m3/s)\
*Shields and Hull reduced from 12000/12000 to 7500/7500 in version .71c.\
*Ore Hold nerfed from 12500 to 12000 and released on limited permit build menu for a Class A Permit in version .73b1.\
*Initial buff: Turn Speed increased from 0.1 to 0.2, and 1 extra Large Patriotic Mining Laser(Had 6 Large Patriotic Mining Lasers) added. This was partially reverted(the extra Large Patriotic Mining Laser was removed), and instead the [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]] health was nerfed from 7,500/7,500 to 7,000/7,000, the Turn Speed was again increased from 0.2 to 0.3, and turret orientations corrected in version .74b14(?).\
*Shields and Hull were increased back to 7,500/7,500 in version .75a10.\
==Trivia==\
*One of the most expensive ships in the game due to requiring a [[Permits|Class A Permit]] to obtain.\
*Released on the third and second-to-last day of the [[Fourth of July Event 2020]]. The late ship reveal caused the event to be extended by 12 hours so players could grind credits to afford it.\
*dijumajo123 sold a [[Prototype X-2]] to get enough credits for this ship.\
*The :cost command estimates the ship's price is 1,113,900 Credits, and it sells for 880,300 Credits.\
*The Freedom Galaxy has 23% more Ore Hold, costs alot more, and has greater mining speed than the [[Galaxy]], it also previously had 166% more top speed until the minimum top speed became 50 ''(which would then be reduced to 45)'', it used to have 20% more combined HP until this ship and the Galaxy both had a health nerf to 7500 in both shields and hull.\
*Makes 22,000-48k Credits depending on ores if transferring ores to Mega Base and 19,000 Credits if Selling to a base/Mega Base at 30% Loyalty.\
*The first person to lose a Freedom Galaxy was Maxcart to Shadiris.\
*Currently, the rarest miner kill in the game with less than 50 known Freedom galaxy deaths.\
*The first person to lose a ship to a Freedom Galaxy was Hudson6539 who lost a Razor Wing to the explosion of superdestroyer12347's Freedom Galaxy.\
*Back then, players could trade their '''Freedom Galaxy''' for various ships and later on, you could trade it with 2 [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]] for a '''[[Prototype X-1]]''' or a '''[[Prototype X-2]].''' Although this trade is frowned upon due to the grinding capabilities, it may allow players to get one of the most highly sought after ships in the game. '''''NOTE THAT THIS TRADE IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE'''''.\
*Used to be obtained during the event from an NPC known as [[Uncle Sam]] when it was released on the third day of the [[Fourth of July Event 2020]] for 3 Million Credits. \

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Apocalypse''' is mostly used as a siege ship or a PvP [[Ships|Ship]]. However, the acceleration and overall mobility is lacking (it moves slowly up and down) which makes it vulnerable to smaller ships. It is capable of many tasks due to its powerful arsenal of [[Turrets]]. This ship is even capable of Solo [[Sieging]] a Level 1 [[Starbase]]. The '''Apocalypse''' has 6020 [[Shields|Shield]] and 5450 [[Hull]] points, making it a great ship for tanking in fleet combat and sieges.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Apocalypse''' is quite small, like the ship itself, as it's similar to [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] in its size. There is an invisible teleporter pad on the top-back section of the ship that the player can step on while the ship is docked. This leads to a small room in the bottom-back area of the ship that is mostly grey and decorated much like the interiors of either Prototype. There is a thinner area of a hallway that opens to a more expansive room with a grey and yellow pilot's seat and a control dashboard/screen.\
== Advantages ==\
* High [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
* Above-average turning speed.\
* Very small for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], Smaller than the [[Loyalist]] which is a Battleship\
* The '''Apocalypse's''' small mini-map icon might fool some pilots into thinking it's a weaker [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Huge blindspot at the bottom- all weapons are mounted on the top of the ship.\
* Lacks small [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower, unable to fend off smaller [[Ships]].\
* It can be overwhelmed by smaller [[Ships]] such as a [[Razor Wing]], and [[Vansnova]].\
== Strategy ==\
* It fails at attacking anything smaller than a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]], as its weapons are very inaccurate. Because of this, always try to stay near a fleet.\
* It is very good at brawling other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], with strong [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower and astounding turnspeed, higher than most other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]\
* It can withstand a lot of damage from [[Turrets|Railguns]], but not very much from [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]]. It is still a good choice as a front line tank given its impressive health pool.\
* If you see an enemy ship always approach from the bottom so you can be sure that its loading won't get the best of you. If the ship is already below you, then you're dead.\
* If dueling other Dreadnoughts, use your small and sleek body to dive under them and unleash your payload, they can't properly attack back and this is the most effective way of using this ship.\
*If your turrets have no line of sight, use your A and D keys to turn your ship or warp under the enemy ship.\
== Version History ==\
* Before it's remake, it carried 3 [[Turrets|Heavy Turrets]],4 [[Turrets|Medium Railguns]], and 2 [[Turrets|Flak Cannons]]. It was based on the '''EVE Online''' model.\
* Its [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]] and [[Turrets|Medium Railguns]] were replaced with [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] and [[Turrets|Dual Medium Railguns]] in .63h.\
* Remodel and turn speed buffed from 0.05 to 0.06 in version .??\
* Max Speed increased from 30 to 35, turn speed increased from 0.06 to 0.14, Hull reduced from 5950 to 5450, Shield reduced from 6420 to 6020, 2 Triple Heavy Lasers replaced with Rapid Fire Lasers in version .66b\
* Dual Medium Cannons and Triple Heavy Lasers replaced with Triple Heavy Cannons and Triple Capital Lasers in version .66b, also received a price buff.\
* Had a huge price reduction in version .66b to $170,878.4.\
* Was given a temporary model in version .68d?\
* Fixed in version .68e.\
* 2 [[Turrets|Capital Triple Lasers]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] and 4 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] changed to 4 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] in version .69a1.\
*4 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] changed to 4 [[Turrets|Lykos Cannon Defense]] in version .72c20.\
*4 Lykos Cannon Defenses changed back to 4 Dual medium Cannons in unknown version.\
*4 Dual Medium Cannons replaced with 4 Heavy Railguns in unknown version.\
*Explosion Size 60 ----> 640 .75a12\
*4x Heavy Railgun ----> 4x Dual Heavy Railgun 2x Triple Heavy Laser / 1x Capital Triple Laser ----> 3x Heavy Quantum Laser 2x Triple Heavy Cannon ----> 2x Heavy Quantum Cannon Top Speed 45 ----> 60 Acceleration 10 ----> 20 .75a20\
== Trivia ==\
* The previous model was often called \"''Lag-pocalypse''\" by many players, due to the ship's parts which caused massive amounts of lag.\
*Had [[turrets]] from an exclusive ship, the [[Lykos]].\
* Commonly referred to as \"''Apoc''\". \
* Featured on the main thumbnail for Galaxy.\
* Used by many people in the Galaxy community for Sieges and PvP.\
* At one point, the ship was \"partially invisible\" due to the 'Ship and Turret Model' issues in version .67c.\
* The original model was free, but had its colors altered. The model was named [https://www.roblox.com/library/36420606/Spaceship Spaceship] and was made by Horeytey.\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Mammoth''' was the first [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] in the game with ''more'' than four [[Turrets|Mining Lasers]] (The ship currently has 4 [[Turrets|Mammoth Mining Lasers]]). The '''Mammoth''', is essentially an upgrade to the [[Rorqual]] (also referenced in the build menu description), as this mines faster and accelerates faster, while its turn speed is lower than the Rorqual, costs more, requires a higher warehouse level, and requires VIP, every other stat is the same as the Rorqual. It has a mining range of 5500 and takes a minimum of, 250 seconds to fill up its hold.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Mammoth''' has a very large interior for its class. The ship is entered through a small stairway at the stern of the ship. From there, a long hallway leads to the main room, containing the pilot's seat and many screens. Another small stairway at the center of the room will take the player downstairs into two smaller rooms. One room is a sleeping quarter, while the other is a small office.\
== Advantages ==\
* Very fast for a [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] of its size.\
* Same total health as [[Rorqual]].\
*Mines faster than the [[Rorqual]].\
*High ore hold.\
*It has high health, allowing it to tank longer than other Miners.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP Gamepass]] is required.\
* The large size makes it a large target, but it is still smaller than the [[M Class]].\
* [[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]], especially those as large of a target as the Mammoth.\
* Quite expensive for its class.\
* Has less turn speed than the [[Rorqual]].\
== Strategy ==\
* Never mine during a [[war]].\
\
* Use the warp if attacked, and watch the chat or [[Minimap]] for [[War]] declarations or incoming [[Pirating|Pirates]]. It is recommended to do a check like this at least a few times a minute.\
* Try to mine in a [[Galaxy VIP Servers|VIP Server]] to avoid pirating players. Be aware that [[Aliens]] can still spawn in these servers.\
* Don't mine at the [[Mega Base]] if at [[War]] and are unprotected. It's not worth it, even with the ability to warp.\
* It's better to mine at large clusters of ores since they are easily harvested and the [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] will not be out of range when mining.\
==Version History==\
* Received a few minor tweaks in .59a affecting mobility and health pool.\
* Received a rebalance in .59d, replacing 4 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] with 8 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]].\
* Received a price change in .59d doubling it's original price.\
* Received a buff that increased its mining range by 50%.\
* Received a nerf in .60d that removed 2 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] and removed the ship's [[Warp Drive]].\
* Reversed the nerf from .60d that removed the 2 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] and removed the [[Warp Drive]].\
* Received a massive buff in .61e4 that doubled health and added ''some'' damage resistance.\
* Received a buff in .61i that increased the ore hold to 5000, but removed 175 Cargo Hold.\
* Top speed reduced to 70, turn speed reduced to 0.3, ore hold and cargo hold buffed to 5,500 and 550, 8 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] switched out with 4 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] and received a remodel in version .68e.\
* Fixed and given a teleporter from the docking point to the pilot's seat in version .68e.\
* Top speed increased to 145, 4 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] switched out with 7 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] prior to version .69a1.\
* 7 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] switched out with 4 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] prior to version .69a1.\
* Top speed reverted to 70 in version .69a1.\
* Received a nerf that made its 4 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] become 4 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] in version .69a2.\
* 4 [[Turrets|Small Mining Lasers]] changed back to 4 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] in version .69a2.\
*Shields increased from 2,000 to 2,500, hull increased from 2500 to 5000, top speed reduced from 70 to 50, acceleration reduced from 29 to 12, turn speed reduced from 0.3 to 0.2 in version .71c3.\
*Shields reduced back from 2,500 to 2,000, Ore hold increased by 1,500 (5,000 to 6,500), and it's 4 Medium Mining Lasers were swapped with 4 Mammoth Mining Lasers in version .75a10.\
*Ore hold reduced to 6,000 a day later. (.75a10)\
== Trivia ==\
* There is a banner in the back of the ship, showing the wolf of House Stark, from Game Of Thrones.\
* It was the second [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] to ever have a [[Warp Drive]]. The first was the [[Harvester]].\
* It's the first and only [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP Gamepass]] ''utility'' ship.\
* A lot of people without [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] got it before it was enforced in the [[Halloween Event 2017]].\
* Brings in around 6500 credits without any [[Loyalty]] per run.\
* Along with the [[Woolly Mammoth]], it was the largest [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] (by model size) in the game until the [[M Class]] was added.\
* During the [[Christmas Event 2017]], this got a \"reskin\" as the [[Woolly Mammoth]], which is the most expensive ship in the entire game (mainly due to the crazy high cost of the Class A Permit).\
* It was repeatedly nerfed upon release to balance it.\
*<nowiki/>Used to be the most expensive [[:Category:Miner|Miner]], but has since been replaced by the [[Galaxy]] and the [[Orca]].\

== Description ==\
The Orca is the second-best non-limited Miner in the ship building menu, but it is not as good as the famous [[Galaxy]]. It features 6 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]], the most for a non-VIP, and non-Event.\
\
Note that the Orca is the best non-VIP, and non-Limited ship, making it very recommended.\
\
Sometimes seen in public servers, though not very often.\
== Appearance ==\
The Orca is one of the few Miners in the game to feature a proper interior. Featuring a seat with many keys and computers around it, many crates, 2 radar screens, 2 lockers and 4 co-pilot seats with screens.\
== Advantages ==\
* Great armament of Mining Lasers.\
* 2nd best non-limited \
* High health tank, making a low number of small ships a minor threat.\
* The best regularly obtainable miner, and the third-fastest refundable miner, with the [[Woolly Mammoth]] being 1st and [[Santa's Workshop]] being 2nd.\
*Rather high top-speed relative to its size.\
* Takes a minimum of just over 3 minutes to fill its ore hold. \
*Has twice the mining speed of the Rorqual.\
* Due to its size and turret placement, it can actually mine, 5900-6.5k forwards.\
*Can make 100k-130k [[Credits]] per hour if you are efficient, making it very good with the more experienced player.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Terrible maneuverability aside from the top speed. Not much of a problem with warp.\
* Massive target, allowing [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]] to hit it with ease.\
* Requires a level 8 warehouse to build, which is expensive for a new player.\
* Requires 2000 [[Ores|Uranium,]] a rare and expensive ore. There is a strategy to get it (WITHOUT HACKING) if you are using the M-class. (See strategy)\
* Due to its size and turret placement, it can only shoot 4100–4300 studs backwards.\
*Slow docking speed. Very annoying if you are trying to escape a NPC or enemy player.\
*A huge target for [[Pirating|Pirates]] due to being the second-best [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] on the build menu, though \
*this is not a problem with a private server.\
== Strategy ==\
* Don't mine during a war.\
* If you have a Private Server, mine there instead.\
* Find large ore fields to fill your ore hold quickly.\
* Warp away from aliens, as they sometimes chase you. If it is a Punisher, your best bet would be to rush back to your Starbase and despawn. The Starbase can finish it off, even if it is level 1.\
*To get the Orca as fast as possible (With the M class) Is that you mine the materials Iridium, Carbon, And Silicate and transfer them to your warehouse. Use 7-8K on the rarer materials (Except for uranium) and get 22K more credits. Then, sell the M class for its standard 40K. With the extra 22K, you will have enough to buy all the uranium you need and enough money for the manufacturing fee. Tested and done in 1.6 Hours. (Editorial Note: '''This strategy is not related to the use of this ship.''' Additionally, this is ''not'' a recommended strategy if you do not have a back-up or replacement Miner that is relatively on par or better than the mining efficiency of the [[M Class]]. It is advised instead to attempt to find the occasional large ore chunks of uranium around [[Frion I]] if it is level 3, in a public server; or otherwise exchange salvaged [[Ores|Plasma Batteries]] for uranium upstairs of terminal D in [[Mega Base]].)\
==Version History ==\
*Explosion Damage nerfed in an unknown version without any further notice.\
*Explosion Damage nerfed even further in an unknown version without any further notice.\
*Cost increased in version .69a.\
*Ore Hold reduced from 7500 to 5000 in version .70a.\
* Ore Hold increased from 5000 to 6500 in version .72a?\
*Cargo hold increased from 500 to 700 in version .75a5\
*Shield reduced from 8000 to 7500 in version .75a5\
*Shield and Hull reduced from 5,000/7,000 to 4,000/4,000 in version .75a10.\
*Ore Hold reduced from 6,500 to 6,000 in version .75a10.\
==Trivia==\
*The '''Orca''' takes inspiration from the EVE Online ship of the same name\
*Previously was a better nuke than the [[E Class]], basically one of the best ship [[Strategies#\"Nuking\"|nukes]] in the game, along with [[Galaxy]] and Prototypes. This was especially effective in [[Galaxy Arcade]] because it could be spawned at any base.\
*Can make around 8.5k-10k per run depending on loyalty.\
* Killing an Orca with 0 bounty gives a 40k bounty increase, making this a nice target for pirates.\
*Used to cost about 166,032.2 credits after buying enough uranium. The 5,000 uranium costs 110,000 credits?.\
*Used to cost 15,000 uranium, making the Orca cost nearly 700,000 credits. It was cut down to 5000 Uranium shortly after, and it now costs 2,000 uranium.\
*The '''Orca's''' explosion damage was nerfed many times due to dealing too much damage, the original pre-nerf explosion damage can deal about 7000 damage to a starbase, it was then nerfed to about 3000 damage to a starbase, and then nerfed yet again to about 1000 damage to a starbase, these nerfs were not mentioned when the explosion damage nerfs happened.\
*It takes about 45 runs with a [[Mammoth]] or [[Rorqual]] if you are doing it with credits and takes about 4 hours to get it with those ships\
*the fastest way to get an Orca is to sell the M class, and get 13k more credits. you can loot to make the process faster.\
*It takes about 4 minutes and 20 seconds for one mining run with this insane miner.\
*As of version .75a10, The Orca is the only miner with a total of 0 Cargo Hold\

== Description ==\
The '''Imperator''' is a very powerful [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] and ''was'' the first of its class to require artifacts to build.\
\
What the Imperator lacks in speed and size it makes up for total its sheer Health. This Ship excels at being one of the flagships in a fleet due to it's health, the diversity of [[Turrets]] it has, and having high firepower.\
\
All these combined, the Imperator can be used as a multi-role ship like other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]].\
== Appearance ==\
The Imperator is one of the largest [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] in the game, being as large as most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]. Its most prominent features are its large bridge window and its two large, angled arms lined with turrets, as well as a central rounded region from which there are spinal barrels, though these shoot no spinals at all. The ship has a futuristic gray and neon styling theme, which is seen in other ships like the [[Prototype X-1]] or the [[Kraken]].\
\
The Interior of the '''Imperator''' starts with a hallway that has the [[Osiris Legion]] flag on each side of the wall, leading up to the pilot cabin, which there is a large screen that displays the text \"<span style=\"color:#aef2fe\">'''Imperator'''</span>\".\
== Advantages ==\
* Highest health of any current [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* Relatively high turn-speed for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* Great for PvP and [[Sieging|Siege]] support.\
* Great firepower and versatility from its 9 [[Turrets]] and 4 [[Spinals|Spinal]] Barrels.\
* The [[Turrets|Auto-Lasers]] provide good defense from smaller [[Ships]].\
* Has 200 Shield & Hull DPS, giving it a total of 313 DPS, which is higher than most [[Build Menu]] ships.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Very large, practically [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]-sized.\
* Has two blind spots, one in the very front in between the arms, and another one behind the ship.\
* Thick profile and top-mounted [[Turrets]] make it hard to shoot ships that move below you.\
* Low range and accuracy for many of its weapons.\
* Somewhat weak to Shield Breakers as it has mainly [[Shields|Shield]]-based health.\
*Despite it having the high health, it still can be fragile due to being a slow and easy to hit target.\
*[[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] ship on a limited rotation, meaning it will be expensive and cannot be reobtained until it is back in rotation.\
== Strategy ==\
**This ship is best used in a fleet, as providing cover for it can make it maximize it's potential, and lessens the chance of getting [[Galaxy Slang|dived]]. \
* Despite some difficulty, it can defend against small ships, however it is best used against larger ships.\
* The Imperator can easily destroy low-tier [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], making it a great ship against [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]] in a fleet if you can manage to stay in their blind spots.\
*Use this ship to chase down crippled [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], as it has high hull damage output. \
* The Imperator is fit for pirating, and is pretty good at it too.\
*Avoid using it to tank too much damage, as its status as a target makes it a priority to destroy over other ships.\
*Use it as a replacement for a Dreadnought if three are already spawned or you do not have enough [[Loyalty]].\
== Version History ==\
* Disabled along with all other Artifact Ships in version .65a (?)\
* Re-enabled in version .65b, but cost increased dramatically to 1 million [[Credits]].\
* Received a unique [[Turrets|Quantum Turret]] and advanced Medium Cannons in version .65b.\
* Quantum Cannon replaced with Quantum Laser in version .66b.\
* [[Shields|Shield Health]] was changed from 5000 to 4500 in version .66b.\
* Price decreased from 1M to 600K in version .66b\
* Maximum [[Shields|Shield]]/[[Hull]] buffed from 4500/3500 to 5500/3850, turn speed buffed from 0.12 to 0.22, armament buffed in version .66c.\
*Made available with every other advanced ship (except [[Osiris]]) for a month in version .69e.\
* Price increased by $400,000 credits in version .69e.\
* Price increased yet again by $500,000 credits in version .69e.\
*Price reduced to 1.4M credits in version .69e.\
*Price changed from 1.4M credits to 3 Antimatter, 1 Ascension, 500K Credits in version .72e1.\
*Price changed from version .72e1 to 500k credits, 1 quantum core, 6 armored plating, 6 plasma batteries, 2 antimatter shards, 2 data archives, and 1 ascension crystal.\
*Added into randomized rotation cycle in .75a. \
*Spinals moved, should be easier to hit now .75a12  \
*Explosion size 100 ----> 450 .75a12  \
== Trivia ==\
* Multiple references to the [[Osiris]], which is an Advanced [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
* Made in the [[Osiris Legion]] Shipyards.\
* Only sells for 62,710 [[Credits]].\
* Can take a Level 1 [[Frion I]] in 6.7 Minutes\
* The player who has lost Imperators the most is ethamberry, who has lost it 15 times.\

''Note that the quest for Borealis is NOT in [[Advanced Ship Computers]], instead, the quest is detailed in this [[Borealis Quest|Page]].''\
\
\
The '''''Borealis''''' is an extremely powerful [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
\
==Description ==\
The '''Borealis''' is a large [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] which carries 12 [[Blitz]]es.\
\
This ship has enormous firepower from its Fighters, making it useful for Sieges and Fleet battles.\
==Appearance==\
The '''Borealis''' has a rather industrial look and has a mostly greyscale colour scheme with splashes of orange here and there. The ship has a very long profile and its dorsal side is littered with various grey, white and orange armour plates, along with many turrets. There are 6 fighter bays on the '''Borealis,''' which fits 2 [[Blitz]], and each bay opens up to both the port and starboard surfaces of the ship. On its ventral side, towards the front of the ship, is a large vertical fin-like protrusion which hosts one turret on both its port and starboard sides each, a feature similar to a hydrofoil-like fin underneath its counterpart. The interior of the '''Borealis''' is taken up almost entirely by the fighter bay. What few decorations exist are limited to the pilot seat room, which has a large Yellow orb and a throne-like pilot's seat with a simple control board.\
==Advantages==\
*Armed with a decent arsenal of [[Turrets]].\
*Extremely High DPS for a carrier with fighters, standing at a monstrous 1050 DPS combined, rivaling that of [[Retro Nyx]].\
*Large health pool of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.shields|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Borealis'}} Shields and {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.hull|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Borealis'}} Hull.\
*It has more consistent Fighter firepower than other carriers of because the [[Blitz]]'s high turret firepower.\
*Has the ability to support itself without its fighters.\
==Disadvantages==\
\
*Extremely slow.\
*Large and easy to hit, especially from underneath or behind it.\
*Large blindspots under and behind the ship.\
*Extremely expensive due to it being an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]] especially as a Carrier, especially requiring a [[Weapons Part]].\
==Strategy==\
* Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.\
* Target AA ships like the [[Hyron]] or [[Ampharos]] so your fighters don't die.\
*Never go alone if you do not have fighters.\
*It can be used as a support [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] in sieges by carrying [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to distract enemy [[Starbase]]s, as well as providing great support from its large fighter swarm.\
*Watch out for fleets of [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] that have the aim of defeating you.\
*Try not to engage when you don't have fighters. This ship is only extremely powerful when paired with its fighters.\
*Go to the bottom of the map, right at the border and release the fighters from below your enemy. Do this because majority of your turrets are on top of the ship so you can fire on anyone who attempts to attack you.\
*Warp in, release all your fighters and then warp out as soon as you can to your nearest or strongest Starbase if you don't want to risk your ship.\
==Version History==\
*One of the ships to receive an event remodel during the [[Halloween Event 2018]]. The remodel is known as the [[Skeletal Ghostealis]].\
* Shields reduced from 12000 to 9000, 4 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Lasers]] and 2 [[Turrets|Medium Cannons]] replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] and 7 [[Turrets|Quantum Cannons]], [[Blitz]] spawns reduced from 16 to 6, re-classified as an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]] and received a remodel in version .69e\
*Got stripped of its [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]] class, and put back on the build menu, shields increased from 9000 to 12000 and 7 [[Turrets|Quantum Cannons]] changed to 7 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] in version .69f, which caused a very massive price increase.\
*Received a total turret loadout overhaul, lost 1200m³ of Cargo Hold Space and price was massively reduced so it is somewhat feasible to get in version .72d.\
*3 Medium Cannons replaced with 3 Quad Advanced Cannons in version .72d.\
*Shields reduced from 12000 to 11000 in version .73a3.\
*Fighter teleport fixed in version .73b8.\
*Reclassified to an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]] again in version .73a37.\
==Trivia==\
*Its quest can be found inside [[Mega Base]], in a hidden location.\
*Has a reskin variant; The [[Skeletal Ghostealis]].\
*The fourth ship to require a [[Weapons Part]] ''(Formerly [[Kraken]])'' and the third ship currently to require a [[Weapons Part]], other than the Prototypes.\
*The only ship that was reclassified as an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]] 2 times.\
*Used to be based on a ship of the same name from Starpoint Gemini Warlords.\
*The current model has a very similar style to the [[Hyperion|Hyperion's]] original model.\
*The vertical front part looks similar to [[Ampharos|Ampharos']] lower part.\

\
== Description ==\
The '''Ridgebreaker''' is a strong hull-focused Dreadnought with 4 prominent [[Spinals|Cannons]] protruding from the front and strong [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower. Most effective when paired with the [[Sagittarius]].\
== Appearance ==\
You enter the bridge to find a red seat in the middle of the room, with a sign saying \"Interior\" on the front wall. Much like the [[Lazarus]] and [[Cyber Leviathan]].\
== Advantages ==\
* Powerful kinetic [[Turrets|Turret]] and [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] firepower, capable of obliterating the hull [[Hull]] of [[Starbase]]s and other [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]].\
* Very high [[Hull]] health for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
* Fast for it's size, although caused by the minimum top speed being 45.\
* Due to the position of the [[Spinals|Spinal]] barrels and the pilot seat, the [[Spinals|Cannons]]<nowiki/>actually have 6800-7000 range.\
* Contains shield-based turrets along with most of the turrets and all spinals dealing high amounts of hull damage.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Incapable of fighting smaller and faster [[Ships]] effectively, if at all.\
* Vulnerable bottom and backside.\
* Slow, and not very maneuverable.\
* Mediocre [[Shields|Shield]] health for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
* [[Spinals|Spinal]] aiming skills needed in PVP.\
* Spinal barrels are far apart, making aiming at close or even medium range, difficult.\
* On the more expensive side of [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
* Mediocre [[Shields|Shield]] damage.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use it as the main tank in [[Sieging|sieges]] for its massive pool of [[Hull]].\
* Try not wasting your [[Spinals]], a considerable amount of your firepower comes from them.\
* Be sure to bring a shield breaker such as the [[Sagittarius]], that way your [[Spinals|Cannons]] and [[Turrets|Railguns]] can do the most hull damage.\
* If alone, keep at a distance of 6.6k-6.8K to pick off the base using [[Spinals]], and retreat when you see defenders incoming.\
* Due to its reliance on kinetic weaponry, this ship is best used when a foe's [[Shields]] have been depleted. It may not be the best idea to be the one soaking up all the initial damage in a [[Sieging|Siege]], due to the fact you want your remaining health to last enough to destroy the [[Starbase|Starbase's]] [[Hull]].\
* A Combination of a [[Sagittarius]] and '''Ridgebreaker''' can be a big threat, as they will dish out damage fast from afar.\
== Version History ==\
* At one point most of its exterior detail was removed leaving some simple decorations in its place, and its living quarters were completely removed.\
* Received a massive buff in .61e4 that boosted Cargo Hold, health, and ship cost.\
* Remodeled in .61h1.\
* Received a [[Turrets|Heavy Railgun]] in .65b.\
* Explosion range increased from 10 to 175 in .65b.\
* Remodeled in .65b.\
* Heavy Lasers were replaced with two [[Turrets|Capital Lasers]] in version .66b\
* Received a slight recolor with Neon parts near the cannons and around the bridge in .66b.\
* Disabled temporarily during version .66b (Re-enabled October 22nd after a partcount decrease).\
* Given 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Cannons]] in version .68e.\
* Capital Lasers along with the Capital Cannons removed in unknown version from all ships equipped with them.\
* Major price increase in version .69a2, Uranium is now required to build.\
*Top Speed increased from 14 to 50 and Turn Speed increased from 0.04 to 0.1 in version .70c1, along with every other ship that had less than 50 Top Speed and less than 0.1 Turn Speed.\
*Explosion Size 175 ----> 740 .75a12\
*2x Triple Heavy Cannon ----> 2x Heavy Siege Railgun .75a20\
*Interior remodeled from 16Clampa .76c\
== Trivia ==\
{{Picture Infobox Mk II|title1 = Old Photos|image = }}\
* The original model had [[Spinals|Torpedoes]], which were removed prior to addition.\
* The current model is based off the original '''Ridgebreaker''' model.\
* Is considered by most players as the best [[Sieging|siege]] [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought.]]\
* The current model received some backlash by the community as it gives it a much larger blind spot on the underside of the ship but also praise as many players liked the original model's four giant barrels.\
* Before rebalances, it was among the most powerful [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts.]]\
* The second model is a reference to the [https://sinsofasolarempire.fandom.com/wiki/Ragnarov_Titan Ragnarov Titan] from [https://sinsofasolarempire.fandom.com/wiki/Rebellion Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion], although perhaps it took inspiration from [https://www.destinypedia.com/Destiny Destiny]'s [https://www.destinypedia.com/Dreadnaught Dreadnaught].\
* Despite having a [[Turrets|Heavy Railgun]] before .66b, the '''Ridgebreaker '''did not receive a [[Turrets|Capital Cannon]] in place of said [[Turrets|Railgun]].\
*Previously had the lowest top speed in the game, at 14, now tied with every ship with a top speed of 45 as the slowest ship in the game, such as [[Orca]], [[Prototype X-1]], [[Ghoul Nyx]], [[Lazarus]] and [[Prototype X-2]].\

The '''''Oblivion''''' is a powerful [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|'''Super Capital Ship''']] and is a powerful all-rounder.\
==Description==\
The '''Oblivion '''is a powerful all-rounder [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]]. It is the third Super Capital to be added to the build menu. Its high health and high damage output allow it to take on most enemy ships effectively. It also comes with unique Rapid Fire [[Turrets]] which have a low reload time.\
==Appearance==\
The '''Oblivion''' has a large profile, with the long length being attributed to two long \"prongs\" that extend from the mid-section of the ship; with the rear-section being larger in volume, housing all the engines and most of the orbital turret mounts. The detailing is of large variety, with the name of the ship in black on both the top and bottom of the front of the ship; and having a mostly gray color with some orange, green, pink, and minor team-color detailing mixed in. There is four \"mo-hawk\"-like protrusions on the mid/rear section of the ship, two of them being of a pink neon color which are on the top and bottom of the center of the ship; and the other two being of orange neon color located on the bottom of the rear section of the ship, at mirrored angles. The interior is a small circular room containing three pink-ish screens, a trash can and the pilot's seat. There is a secret teleporter approximately to the right of the center screen that leads to a secret shrine dedicated to Elon Musk. The center screen reads out: ''<span style=\"color:#5500FF\">\"Oblivion systems: ONLINE\"</span>''. The right screen is an animated screen, which is a constant scroll animation of a script in the Roblox Studio script editor. The left screen shows a silhouette of the ship itself. The trash can contains a picture of the [[Harvester]], a currently retired ship.\
\
==Advantages==\
* Good damage output for a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]], thanks to the unique turrets and [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]].\
* Fairly good mobility for it's size.\
* Large health pool allows it to take a beating from enemy ships.\
* Large explosion value of 1250.\
* High [[Hull]] damage makes it great for finishing off crippled ships.\
* Very versatile for a Super Capital. It can chase hulled ships, siege Starbases, and fight Capital Ships.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Very large making it easy for [[Spinal Weaponry|Torpedoes]], and inaccurate Turrets to hit you.\
* Vulnerable underside.\
* Its versatility means it doesn't excel at anything specific.\
* 4,800 stud range on the Rapid Fire turrets, which is rather short for turrets of their size and type.\
* Poor accuracy with the turrets makes fighting smaller ships (like some [[:Category:Battleship|battleships]] or fast moving dreadnoughts like the [[Leviathan]]) from a distance difficult.\
\
==Strategy==\
* Use in a fleet as [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]] will be targeted. Alone, a few powerful Capital Ships can destroy you.\
* Use this ship to chase down crippled [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], as it has high hull damage output.\
* Avoid swarms of small, agile ships; your turrets aren't accurate enough to hit and destroy them, on top of your size and maneuverability making easy for the swarms to stay in your blind-spots. Bring support ships if possible to protect yourself.\
* Avoid fighting ships like the [[Astraeus]] which are able to use their long range and high alpha damage against you without support. This ship is capable of a lot, but do not forget that its range is rather limited.\
\
==Version History==\
* Added in .66b\
* Disabled in .66b along with the other [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]] due to [[Materials|Weapons Part and Alien Part]] duplicating.\
* Re-added in .66b with a cost of 5 million [[Credits]] instead of 2.5mil Credits, 33000 [[Materials|Uranium]], and 1000 [[Materials|Silicate]].\
* Price nerfed to 2 million Credits in version .66b.\
* [[Turrets|Turret]] placement changed in version .66c.\
* Added to the build menu, turret loadout changed, and acceleration/turn speed increased from 8/0.1 to 13/0.15 in version .72e1.\
* Small torpedo spinals removed and 2 multi-gunned Huge Cannons added in place, 5 Huge Cannons decreased to 3 Huge Cannons and multi-gunned in version .75a5.\
* [[Hull]] health increased from 10,000 to 10,750 in an unknown version.\
* Turret armament changed from 2 Heavy Quantum Lasers, 2 Capital Triple Cannons, 1 Capital Triple Laser, 2 Huge Triple Cannons, and 2 Huge Triple Lasers to 2 Rapid Fire Quantum Lasers, 2 Rapid Fire Quantum Cannons, 2 Rapid Fire Cannons, and 2 Rapid Fire Lasers in an unknown version.\
==Trivia==\
* The second super capital ship to have [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]].\
*The ship contains a hidden room nicknamed by the galaxy player base the \"Church of Musk\". The teleporter for this secret area (while slightly buggy) can be found near the left screen. However, the room is currently broken and if a player teleports into it they become stuck and cannot move. Most of the time they are able to rotate to use the teleporter again but occasionally they get stuck and have to reset.\
*The ship has alien text to the left and right of the hull-mounted turrets respectively, which translates to \"KNEALL\". Why this is here is completely unknown, however.\

==Description==\
The '''Helios''' is a swift and hard hitting [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship.]]\
\
This ship excels at providing firepower support in fleets and [[Galaxy Terminology|Diving]] Ships with it's high firepower. It is able to effectively evade fire and dish out extreme damage with it's speed and agility in most situations. All these combined, the Helios can be used as a multi-role ship like other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]].\
==Appearance ==\
The Helios has an extremely flat and [[wikipedia:Crane (bird)|Avian]] shape with wing shapes resembling that of a Crane's. On the front of it can be seen it's main spinal barrel. It has 2 long forks extending out of its 2 main wings. Both edges of the main wing change their color depending on the team's color.\
\
The Interior is a black room with a pilot seat and a teleporter leading outside.\
== Advantages==\
*Very high damage output with its advanced [[Turrets]] and [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]], being higher than most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*Fast and flat, allowing for easier dodging and reduced damage when [[Strategies#Drifting|Drifting]].\
*Insanely fast and agile for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]], having a top speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.top_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Helios'}} and {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turn_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Helios'}} Turn Speed.\
* Large Cargo Hold for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
* One of the few ships with 100% [[Strategies#Drifting|Drift]] Percentage.\
*Speed, Maneuverability, and Firepower all make up for the Helios' lack of hull integrity.\
*Massive Shield and Hull damage, equal to the [[Sagittarius]] and the [[Ridgebreaker]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*Extremely low [[Hull]].\
*Weaker against, and capable of being easily destroyed by shield shredding targets.\
*When the '''Helios''' is not in rotation, you cannot get it again after you lose it until the next rotation.\
* Expensive cost and [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] classification makes for a high priority target.\
* Large [[Galaxy Slang|blindspot]] underneath the ship.\
==Strategy==\
*Use your high mobility to out maneuver most [[Ships]] and obliterate [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] with ease.\
* Drift to minimize the damage you receive using your 100% [[Strategies#Drifting|Drifting]] Percentage.\
*Don't attack large fleets that can shoot accurately enough to counter your speed.\
*Always try to hit your spinals, they account for a large portion of your DPS.\
*Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship. The Helios can do tremendous amounts of damage, but being targeted greatly increases your chances of being destroyed.\
*This ship is good for [[Pirating]] bigger [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters.]] \
*Avoid going too close to a Capital Ship, as you will have a hard time hitting your Spinals and their Turrets will shred you.\
*Avoid Shield Breakers such as the [[Zeus]], as they will break your [[Shields]] and destroy you easily.\
*[[Warp Drive|Warp]] away as soon as you can BEFORE you get your [[Shields]] destroyed because of your extremely low [[Hull]].\
* Be wary when attacking ships larger than [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] as their powerful weaponry could easily tear you apart.\
*A powerful counter to small siege fleets, as most siege ships have very inaccurate [[Turrets]].\
*Warp into fights later, your low health and high hull damage make it a better option for survival and kill stealing.\
*Effective against pirates due to the high speed, high hull damage, flat shape, and shield based health.\
*Like other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships,]] it is extremely effective in swarms. Gather a few more of this ship for extremely devastating DPS capable of quickly destroying almost any normal ship.\
==Version History==\
*Added in .66b\
*Max speed decreased from 160 to 145, Phaser size reduced from Huge to Large, spinal firing interval increased from 0.01/0.1s (Cannon/Phaser) to 0.4/0.4s.\
*Shield buffed from 4000 to 4750, Cannon/Phaser interval decreased from 0.4/0.4s to 0.1/0.2s in version .66c.\
*Made available with every other advanced ship (except [[Osiris]]) for a month in version .69e.\
*Price increased by $400,000 credits in version .69e.\
*Price increased yet again by $500,000 credits in version .69e.\
*Version .72f buffed the speed of the Helios from 135 to 175.\
*Both spinal count increased by 1, acceleration increased to 50, turn speed increased to 0.45, speed increased from 175 to 185, put on the build menu for the month (Osiris would be taken offsale due to this) in version .73a3.\
*Loses an additional large cannon (Spinals )(6 -> 5) .75a12\
*Explosion size 95 ----> 400 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*Named after the Greek sun god '''Helios.'''\
*First player to lose a '''Helios''' was DanXD911 to Dalencylo.\
*Very similar to the EvE Online ship [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Orthrus Orthrus.]\
*Was once in rotation at the same place where May's Ship, the [[Imperator]] was on sale at the U.N.E base in the second \"ring\"<sup>(when?)</sup>.\
*Assuming that you hit all your [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] and the [[Turrets]] don't miss, it will destroy a [[M Class]] in about 12 seconds.\

==Description==\
The '''Punisher''' fits between the player ship classifications of [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]. It has considerable health and firepower and is almost never seen alone. It poses a significant threat to battleships or below, even most dreadnoughts if the supporting fleet is large enough, however, [[Starbase]]s, even level ones can kill it and its escorts. It is mostly black with a few areas highlighted in neon green.\
==Behavior==\
Much like the [[Swarmer]], '''Punishers''' will maneuver to a range of 3K to 5K studs away from their targets and will move back and forth along that range. They may also attempt to out speed attacking ships to stay out of player [[Turrets|Turret]] range. Additionally, '''Punishers''' initiating an attack will '''\"call\"''' all other [[Aliens]] in the server to their location, in which other aliens will stop whatever they are doing, and warp to the Punisher's location, having the potential to create incredibly powerful and dangerous fleets capable of taking down even starbases. The only warning to these gatherings is a small period of time in which all Alien ships will ''turn towards the attacking '''Punisher''''', which can be seen on the [[Minimap]]. If the Punisher's target attempts to flee, regardless of health, the Punisher (and any other aliens) will give chase. Following the appearance of [[Decimator]], the Punisher can also \"'''call'''\" the entire fleet around the map to destroy player's starship or Starbase.\
==Strategy==\
Despite their rather low chance of spawning, '''Punishers''' are not that rare a sight. Attack these with caution; use either a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] or a fleet of [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and/or [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]]. It is also helpful to lure '''Punishers''' closer to armed bases to deal even more damage. Skilled players have been able to solo them without [[Starbase]] help using [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]]. Some extremely skilled players can solo them without the help of [[Starbase]] firepower in only a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] or [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]]. Be sure to take out other aliens other than the Punisher so that when it calls for reinforcements, it will not be able to receive any backup because they were destroyed. Prioritize taking out Punisher before other reinforcements arrive as the Punisher will often act as a Command Ship. If the player is outnumbered and outgunned, practically when there is a Decimator and far outside the Starbase, escape is the first priority and do not let the Punisher gave chase.\
\
\
If you want to upgrade your level one starbase really quick, or just get your base some credits, then take out a frigate, cruiser, or any small ship than can dodge the '''Punisher's''' shots easily. Ideally you would choose a frigate. An [[Avenger]] is recommended because of its turrets and speed, or you can use the cheaper option, the [[Raven]]. All small ships get the job done though, and you will very likely have the same exact results despite your choice of ship. Warp to the '''Punisher''', then shoot the '''Punisher''' until it starts shooting back at you, then warp to your starbase. The '''Punisher''' should follow you, if it does not, then keep trying until it does. Once the '''Punisher''' takes the bait and follows you to your starbase, let the starbase kill it while you despawn your ship. The starbase should deal with it easily. The combat reward that the starbase gets from killing it is good enough to upgrade your base to level 2 or 3 depending on how many reinforcements it has. After it dies, you can also loot the Plasma Batteries it drops, a very valuable drop that can be exchanged for Uranium.\
==Loot==\
'''Punishers''' currently drop 100 Alien Parts and 3 Plasma Batteries.\
== Trivia ==\
* Has an explosion value of 65\
* The '''Punisher''' got a remodel in version .65a6.\
* The first '''Punisher''' model was larger than some [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
* Has a purple trail.\
* If you fly close to a punisher, you can hear it humming. The siren is an alarm from Alien: Isolation.\
* When primary focused on an attack it tries to get away to one of the borders without warping to escape. This mostly happens when soloing a punisher in a dreadnought or a battleship.\
* Like the [[Swarmer]], the Punisher received a Halloween remodel for the 2019 Halloween Event, known as \"Punisher Pie\", and receiving a brown Punisher icon, eventually being removed for lag issues.\
* At the same time, in the Halloween upgrade, the Punisher got a loot buff adding an extra 500 Uranium to the drop when killed, eventually being increased to 750 Uranium, making alien hunting extremely profitable.\
* A crashed punisher can be seen on [[Myriad III]], another being visible on [[Pyramus]], although using a previous model.\
* The punisher was temporarily replaced by the [[Alien Scourge]] in .69b5\
*The punisher third railgun was removed in an unknown version, it was the only ship for the longest time to have 10 turrets.\
*The punisher also had a blue nametag at the 4th of July event.\
* In version .73c8(?), the [[Turrets|Medium Alien Railgun]] turrets were significantly nerfed; they lost their Alien classification and were defaulted to standard medium railguns. This caused the '''Punisher''' and the [[Decimator]] to become laughably weak ships compared to what they were before.\
* Old photos can be seen here:\
*When using the \":cost\" command, as with other alien ships, the text is \"No one around here knows how to build one of those\".\
*Pirates have been observed chasing aliens that were called to a calling alien ship's location.\

\
The '''''Nightmare''''' is an extremely powerful and agile [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]]''' [[:category:Frigate|Frigate]]'''.\
\
==Description==\
The '''Nightmare''' is an incredibly fast and highly maneuverable [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] and the only one equipped with [[Turrets|Auto-Cannons]]. On top of that, its damage profile is balanced out between [[Shields]] and [[Hull]], so it excels at adapting to combating enemy ships. It also can defend against unbalanced ships, and escape easily if all else fails with it's agility. \
\
All these combined, the Nightmare can be used as a multi-role ship like other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]].\
==Appearance==\
The Nightmare has a long and thin profile for a [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]]. It has a somewhat older look compared to the other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]] with it's detailing and orange tinted glass. It features a large spinal barrel on the front; it's size almost half of the ship itself, and 4 long angled engines on the back, with similar design to the [[Zhen]].\
\
The '''Cockpit''' of the Nightmare is fully made of glass, tinted with orange, from top to bottom, with control panels on the front.\
==Advantages ==\
* Has special [[Turrets]] that completely shred small ships.\
*The Highest DPS for a [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]], being higher than some [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
*Very fast, and highly maneuverable.\
* Powerful [[Spinals]] for its class.\
*Deals [[Galaxy Slang|Balanced]] damage to [[Shields]] and [[Hull]].\
*Can reliably fight big and small [[ships]] alike with its amazing armament and speed.\
*Flat design makes it harder to hit.\
*Can easily hide in blind spots of slower, larger ships while dealing high damage.\
*Small spinals reload and move quickly, making it easier to deal great damage when dogfighting.\
==Disadvantages==\
*One of the most expensive [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] so far at 100,000 Credits and 5 [[Plasma Battery|Plasma Batteries]].\
*Has a mere 1200 total health, and [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate]] damage resistance, meaning it won't last long under heavy fire.\
*''[[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]]''; if you lose it, it's gone until it comes back into rotation.\
* Can be destroyed with little difficulty by ships with precision weapons.\
==Strategy==\
*This ship excels at Dogfighting: due to its Speed and Turn Speed, it can pick at its targets with less risk of taking high damage from the likes of the [[Spectre]] or other [[Spinals|Spinal]]-based ships.\
*Turn your Nightmare 90 Degrees from its axis then [[Strategies#Drifting|Drift]], but with Z and C, this makes it much more harder for enemies to hit you.\
*The Nightmare is quite literally a \"'''Nightmare'''\" for any stray [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] or [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] due to its fantastic agility.\
*Use your extreme agility to exploit [[Galaxy Slang|Blindspots]].\
*Pilots using this ship need to be skilled in aiming [[Spinal Weaponry]] due to most of the firepower coming from Spinals.\
* If a ship with high-accuracy [[Turrets]] starts picking at your health, don't hesitate. Warp to quickly reposition yourself in a weak spot and use your exceptional Turn Speed to stay positioned in this spot.\
*Because the spinal barrel placement is more widespread, use A and D to tilt your ship to make sure you hit the most [[Spinals]] possible.\
* Be extremely cautious around [[Galaxy Slang|AA]] ships like the [[Ampharos]], their turrets will easily shred you.\
*Always target slow, inaccurate ships. They usually have multiple blind spots and difficulty hitting smaller ships like the Nightmare.\
*Use this ship in swarms to completely obliterate slow ships like most [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
* When fighting carriers, hide in the fighter bay and use your spinals. If they warp a short distance, quickly move into another blind spot or warp away.\
* Beware of any explosions from ships you destroy; Your health will lead to a quick destruction if you don’t pay attention.\
==Version History==\
*Re-Introduced in Version .74b14 with a cost of 60k Credits and 4 Plasma batteries.\
*Top Speed reduced from 290 to 250 shortly after it being introduced as of version .64f.\
*Disabled along with all other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]] (previously identified as Artifact Ships) in version .65a.\
*Re-enabled in version .65b, but cost increased dramatically to 150,000 [[Credits]].\
*Made partially limited in version .66b due to the Advanced Ship Rotations.\
** Re-introduced in the October 2019 [[Shady Dealer|Advanced Ship rotation]].\
*Turn speed reduced from 0.9 to 0.75 in version .66b.\
*Received a remodel and custom turrets in version .66j3.\
*Made available with every other advanced ship (except [[Osiris]]) for a month in version .69e.\
*Price increased to 150k in version .69e.\
*1 [[Turrets|Compact Advanced AutoLaser]] and 1 [[Turrets|Compact Advanced AutoCannon]] removed in version .69e.\
*Price increased yet again to 275k in version .69e.\
*Re-enabled in version .72d with a new cost of 1 antimatter shard and 125k credits.\
* Price nerfed to 60k credits and 5 plasma batteries in an unknown version.\
*Price Increased to 100k credits 5 plasma batteries and 1 ascension crystal in version .75a5.\
*Reclassification from [[Category:Destroyer|Destroyer]] to [[Category:Frigate|Frigate]] in version .75a23.\
==Trivia==\
*During a while, when the '''Nightmare''' was re-released, selling this ship would have given a negative credit value, meaning that you needed to pay to lose the ship. This may also apply to getting it destroyed. This is because the ship had [[Debt Token]]s used in the 'construction'. They were dropped if you wanted to loot one.\
*The current model was submitted as a [[Zhen]] remodel.\

The '''Theia''' is a PVP ship capable of dishing out enormous amounts of damage in a short time with its [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]].\
== Appearance ==\
The Theia is an extremely long and slender [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] that has many defining features including its \"Power Core\" located visibly in the middle of the ship as a large blue orb and 2 engines accompanying it on the sides. Its long Spinal barrel in the front taking almost 1/3 of the length of the Ship. An extremely large single engine located at the back of the ship almost being as large as its spinal barrel. The overall appearance of this ship makes it look like a large gun with engines attached to it than a ship.\
\
The Interior of the Theia is a rather small but detailed room. When you first enter, it has a stairs with two Computers beside that lead to the pilot's seat. Inside the pilot seat room, there is a large black screen with the logo of the [[Event Horizon|Event Horizon Shipyards]] on each end of it citing its Manufacturer. It has the same color scheme as other ships by [[Event Horizon|Event Horizon Shipyards]] such as the [[Osiris]]. \
== Advantages ==\
*Fast turn speed for a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]], and even faster than many [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*Doesn't have many blind spots.\
*Nearly triple the spinal DPS of the [[Oblivion]], with almost equal [[Turrets|turret]] DPS.\
*[[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] and [[Turrets|Turret]] damage output are insane, both making up almost each half of the '''Theia's''' DPS.\
*Extremely high DPS. The '''Theia''' is the highest DPS ship in Galaxy, with the exception of the [[Prototype X-2]] having higher DPS at 5% or more loyalty.\
*[[Spinals]] are packed close together, making them easier to land.\
*Decent speed and acceleration allows it to outpace many [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
\
== Disadvantages ==\
*'''Lowest total health''' out of all [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]], at 19,000 HP.\
*Can be difficult to use alone due to the low health for a Super Capital.\
*Difficult to obtain or re-obtain due to extremely expensive cost of [[Permits|SC permits]].\
*A little over half of its DPS relies on Spinal aiming, which can be difficult because of the low maneuverability.\
*Rather inaccurate turrets are (mostly) incapable of hitting anything smaller than a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
*Limited effective range with the turrets and low HP for a Super Capital ends up making this ship unsuitable for sieging.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use the ship while solo only if you are confident that you won't die. Always have a fleet with you.\
* Make sure to not attack Fleets or [[Starbase]]s without a fleet of your own.\
* Use the extremely high firepower of this ship to focus and destroy capital ships like Battleships or Dreadnoughts in ridiculous speeds.\
* Pay attention and check the Minimap often to make sure you're not about to be ambushed. Your low health and status as a Super Capital Ship means you must always avoid damage as much as possible.\
* It is not a good idea to siege with this ship because of its low health and limited range.\
* When fighting, stay pointed exactly in line with other Super Capital Ships in fights so that all your weapons have a line of sight.\
* Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship. The Theia can do tremendous amounts of damage, but being targeted greatly increases your chances of being destroyed.\
* Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]].\
* Know when to warp away, judging by the DPS of the other ships targeting you, or when your shield drops to dangerous levels.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .66b\
* Price heavily reduced from 11 million to 2 million in .66b\
* Due to meshing issues in .67c, this ship was partly invisible.\
* Received a remodel in version .67f.\
*3 [[Spinals|Large Phasers]] removed in version .69e.\
*Shields/Hull reduced from 11500/10000 to 9000/9000, turn speed increased from 0.1 to 0.13, top speed increased from 50 to 53, cargo hold reduced from 2500 to 2350, turret loadout changed to 1 Huge Quad Laser, 2 Huge Triple Cannons, 1 Huge Triple Laser, 2 Capital Triple Lasers, 2 Capital Triple Cannons, spinals changed to 6/6 Huge Phasers/Cannons, description changed and re-released to the build menu in version .72c12, now requiring one \"SC Build Permit\" and regular materials to create.\
*Shields/Hull increased from 9000/9000 each to 10000/10000 in version .73d7.\
*Taken offsale along with the rest of the Super Capitals in version .75a5 to reduce permit prices.\
*Shields/Hull reduced to 9500/9500 in version .75a.\
*Spinals unmultigunned, 10 Huge Phaser -> 16, phaser interval 0.1 -> 0.05, custom spinal reload .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*'''Theia''' is also the name of the Greek goddess [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia Theia] which is also named Euryphaessa.\
*The first person to lose this ship was someguy3333333333 to HydroRider's [[Prototype X-2]]\
*The original model appeared to have [[Turrets|Super Capital Turrets]] on each side, which were actually spinal barrels.\
*Had a random ~120 DPS nerf for a week or so in version .75a before returning to normal.\
*The ship's description was formerly ''\"The Sister ship of the Hyperion, due to the Hyperion lacking in close range combat the OSY developed its counterpart for close ranged combat. Unmatched firepower amongst its class.\"'', before it was changed upon release of the ship to the build menu in version .72c12.\

==Description==\
The '''Carvainir''' is a [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]]-like [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] armed with [[Turrets]]. This ship has average speed, and a good amount of '''hit-points''' and '''cargo space''' for its class.  \
==Appearance==\
The ship docks with the front of the ship facing the terminal. Players can walk forward through the entrance door to find a large lobby filled with detail. On the left and right of the entrance are two signs with quotes on them. The quotes are: \"Five letter word for happiness? \"Money\" and \"We shall not refuse our guests even the most ridiculous request.\" When you walk forward you will see three walkways; the one in front leads to a tall ladder that goes up to the pilot's seat, the one on the right leads to a meeting room with a table and some chairs, and the one to the left leads to a small office room with some desks and chairs in it. If you jump off the main path, you will find a large workspace with a hologram that stretches around the entire area, with lots of office chairs around it. Finally, there is a huge hologram-orb in the center that looks like a power core of some sort.\
\
'''(Please add exterior appearance)'''\
==Advantages==\
*Can fend off weak [[Aliens|Alien]] and [[Pirating|Pirate]] [[Ships]] with its [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]].\
*Great health for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]], being higher than a couple of [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*Incredibly detailed and large interior, assuming you care about interiors.\
*Good cargo hold for a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]].\
==Disadvantages==\
*Incredibly vulnerable to swarming, it lacks any sort of good defense against smaller ships which are able easily maneuver into close range and cause issues with turret line of sight; on top of very sluggish maneuverability.\
*Turret mounting on the ship means that at least 1-2 of the 8 turrets will never be able to fire at a single target at any time due to line of sight issues (or otherwise roll the ship to an awkward and difficult to maintain narrow angle, where either the left or right of the ship is directly facing the target). Combined with the ship's already very poor firepower, it makes for what is practically an armored pinata with only a peashooter for self-defense.\
*When facing enemies frontally, only a few turrets will be capable of engaging.\
*Poor at combat against other ships of its class.\
*Rather large, making it easier for Spinals and Turrets to hit.\
== Strategy==\
* Warp to the wreck you wish to loot. If there is an enemy, quickly fire at them, but focus on getting the loot. Warp out once you get it.\
*Do not engage on [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] or [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]] if possible. Some [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers]] are even able to pose a significant threat if you have no support, not to mention how large of a target this ship is to most [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ships]]; which are capable of easily destroying your ship.\
*Try not to trade using this ship.\
*Never use this to raid a base, as it lacks the firepower and is a big target.\
*Using the Turrets on the '''Carvanir''', you can warp to the nearest [[Aliens|Alien]] or [[Pirates|Pirate]] and engage it. Once you destroy the target, you can easily loot it and move over to the next one. You can then sell that to the [[Mega Base]] for credits or transfer to warehouse. Keep in mind that the target can outrun you, warping to keep up with it is key to keep your turrets in range.\
*To get full turret line of sight, point the left or right of the ship directly towards the target. However, this is difficult to maintain and can easily result in several turrets losing line of sight if there are even slight deviations in angle towards the target.\
*Use this ship to bait [[Pirates]] at [[Mega Base]] and finish them off.\
==Version History==\
*Received a remodel in .61g.\
*Received 250 more Cargo Hold and another remodel in .61h(?).\
*Stats changed in .63h to add 1000 to [[Shields|Shield]]/[[Hull]], Top Speed lowered from 85 to 75, and the price increased.\
*Was reclassed from [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] to [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] in .66b.\
*VIP Gamepass requirement was removed in version .66b.\
*2 [[Spinals|Large Cannons]] downsized to 2 [[Spinals|Medium Cannons]] in an unknown version.\
*Shields increased from 2300 to 3500, 2 [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannons]] added, 2 [[Turrets|Light Lasers]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Light Flak Cannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]] changed to 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] in version .70a.\
*Reclassed from [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] to [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] in version .71b.\
*Explosion size 50 ----> 280 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*The '''Carvainir''' was the very first [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] to have armaments.\
*One of the rarest ships in the game, as few people notice or use them, as well as it being much too expensive for most players.\
*Previously the first [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] to require a [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP Gamepass]].\
*The 2 Quotes on the walls of the first and current model are from Mr. Krabs in the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants. The quotes are: \"Five letter word for happiness? Money\" and \"We shall not refuse our guests even the most ridiculous request.\"\

The '''''Obliterator''''' is an extremely powerful [[Aliens|Alien]]-themed [[:Category:Dreadnought|'''Dreadnought''']].\
\
==Description==\
The '''''Obliterator''''' is a Dreadnought themed off of the [[Decimator]], but with different stats than the ship it is derived from.\
\
This ship is ideal at providing firepower support in fleets against capital ships and [[Galaxy Terminology|Diving]] Ships with it's extremely high firepower.\
\
==Appearance==\
The Obliterator is a mid-sized Dreadnought with shaping and design extremely similar to the [[Prototype X-2]] and the [[Annihilator]], with neon pink and green outlines and dark grey coloring. It has 4 small wings located at the back of the ship with a small, non-functional barrel attached to them. At the back has its 6 thrusters which looks extremely similar to the thrusters of the [[Prototype X-2]] and the old model of the [[MRLS Launcher]].\
\
The Interior of the '''Obliterator''' is well detailed, and consists of a pilot seat identical to that seen on [[Prototype X-2]]. There is a large wall at the front embedded in force field material, imprinted on it is \"WELCOME, USER!\"''(like the Prototype X-2)'' and the [[Kneall]] faction symbol. There is also a scrolling sidebar of text near the top of the front wall, informing the pilot of alien ships in the immediate area that UNE is offering a 700,000 credit reward for the successful capture of said ships. To the right of the pilot seat contains a board similar to that seen in the [[Mega Base]] for translating Kneall text to English, and to the left contains miscellaneous pictures of objects; including but not limited to: a diagram of a Kneall mechanical soldier ''(the ones you see at [[Aqueous II]] when it is level 1)'', and an image of a pizza slice holding balloons with a text description similar to the style of a documented SCP object. The back of the interior has a blast door behind some more strange force field material, although the teleporter to get out of the ship is located in front of the door. At the front wall, there is text written in alien language, spelling out \"DECIMATOR\" but backwards.\
==Advantages==\
* Incredibly high turn speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turn_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Obliterator'}} makes repositioning for line of sight easier.\
* Very high [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
* DPS higher than most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and even some [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]].\
* Good balanced health, similar to that of the [[Osiris]].\
* Great [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] firepower.\
* Has an overwhelming effectiveness in PvP against other [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], aside from very agile ships like the [[Cyber Leviathan]], or the [[Helios]].\
==Disadvantages==\
* Little to no firepower on the backside of the ship.\
* This ship struggles to be effective against ships any smaller than a [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] without the help of good spinal aim, due to the very inaccurate turrets and their extremely poor tracking accuracy against moving targets.\
*Must be somewhat facing forward towards an enemy to have all turrets hit and to aim spinals.\
*Extremely expensive for a Dreadnought, requiring numerous materials such as a [[Kneall Core]], [[Thrust Component]]s, [[Plasma Battery]] and [[Dimensional Alloy]].\
==Strategy==\
* Use your fast turn speed to your advantage by covering your blind-spots and quickly repositioning yourself.\
* You can brawl and overpower against other capital ships with this, but be very wary of any surprise attacks from their team. Unless you have significant support you will likely be chased until you are destroyed.\
* Try not to engage small [[Ships]], as your Turrets are not accurate enough to hit them.\
* It cannot support itself well without a fleet, so try staying in a fleet.\
* Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.\
* Watch out for swarms of small ships, as the ship is very vulnerable to them due to the inaccurate turrets.\
* Don't be reckless with this ship; due to its power and expense, it is a high priority target.\
==Version History==\
*Spinal firing interval nerfed from 0.1 seconds to 0.2 seconds on both spinals shortly after release of the ship in an unknown version.\
*Health buffed from 8500 shields to 9000 shields and hull from 6000 to 7000. In return, the obliterator lost 2 auto kneall lasers but gained 2 huge spinal phasers and 2 huge spinal cannons in an unknown version\
*Ambience was changed in version .75a3.\
*Explosion Size 450 ----> 800 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*Has an extremely similar interior with the [[Annihilator]].\
*The Obliterator has trails, but is not visible because of an unknown bug.\
*This ship has been referred to as the \"Player Decimator\".\
*The first person to lose an '''Obliterator''' was MessHerUp to a [[Starbase]]'s [[Starhunter]].\
\
*One of the pictures on the left wall in the interior is an image of the [[Chad Swarmer]], an [[:Category:Admin|Admin Ship]].\
*A good method of getting alien parts requires waiting at mega base for somebody to sell some, and quickly buying them. Another option is asking for some, or simply hunting many, many aliens.\
*The quest for the Kneall Core can be found at the [[Nautilus]] wreck via the quest [[The Last Signal]], the quest for Dimensional Alloy can be found at [[Dimensional Cache]], and the quest for Thrust Components can be found at the [[Engine Manufacturing (Quest)|Leviathan Wreck]].\
*Obliterator, along with [[Kraken]] were supposed to be Limited ships. However, when they got removed, it caused a massive outrage in the community. So the developers had to concede and re-add these ships. Currently, even after half a year of being available, there is no plan of making Obliterator and Kraken off-sale.\

\
==Description ==\
The '''Avalon''' is a small but powerful [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] that can fire a volley of [[Spinals|Torpedoes]]. Its spinals are incredibly deadly if they connect, however they can be hard to hit against faster and/or smaller targets. The '''Avalon's '''total health is very low for its class and it has subpar maneuverability, making it easy to overwhelm this ship with another [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] or even a strong [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] such as the [[Nautilus]].\
\
It is one of the most popular choices for a siege ship, as its spinals provide an extremely long range and a high damage output. It can also somewhat function as a glass cannon support in PVP, however its low health for its class and poor maneuverability severely limits its potential in ship combat. This Dreadnought is also surprisingly effective at warding off small ships thanks to its multiple [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defence Lasers]] and [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]]. \
== Appearance==\
The interior is small but detailed. The player enters through a teleporter at the rear of the ship into a square room inside the ship with a control seat in the rear, with screens surrounding it.\
== Advantages==\
*Extremely high hull damage output thanks to the torpedoes, making this ship incredibly effective against hulled ships.\
*[[Spinals|Huge Torpedoes]] have a very high maximum range of 12,000 studs, giving this ship the ability to outrange [[Starbase]]s (and most ships) by a wide margin.\
*Very good for pirating large miners and freighters (Prepavaca, Orca, E Class etc.) with its high hull damage.\
*Large cargo hold; especially efficient at looting [[Starbase]]s right after a successful siege.\
* Good overall damage for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
*Moderately high alpha damage.\
*Despite being primarily a hull breaker, it still has very respectable shield damage.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Lowest total health of all dreadnoughts excluding the [[SR-71]], which has absurdly low health.\
*Relies on its torpedoes for 2/3 of its total damage output; this, along with the fact that huge-sized torpedoes require a considerable amount of expertise to use effectively, means that inexperienced players will struggle to achieve the full potential of this ship.\
*Turning and acceleration are rather sluggish.\
*Is on the expensive side for a [[Build Menu|regular]] Dreadnought.\
== Strategy==\
*The '''Avalon''' can be used as a hull breaker to dive hulled ships. However, beware of the ship's low health, as it will not be able to resist damage for long if full diving into a [[Starbase]] and/or enemy fleet. Alternatively, you can try to place yourself out of reach, although hitting the torpedoes will become much harder at a longer range.\
*Point your ship towards the enemy; this ensures all weapons have a line of sight and can hit the target.\
*If you're participating in a [[Sieging|siege]], stay at a more distant range where your torpedoes will hit the [[Starbase]] but the base cannot fire back at you. If someone is tanking the base, you can warp in and use your turrets for extra damage.\
* Pay attention and check the [[Minimap]] often to make sure you're not about to be targeted. Your relatively low health means you must always avoid damage.\
* Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship. The Avalon can do a lot of damage, but being targeted greatly increases your chances of being destroyed.\
*Encourage your team to bring more Avalons or other ships with torpedoes and at least one support ship for smaller enemies. A torpedo siege is a very effective and straight-forward way to destroy a starbase. If anybody in a large ship tries to defend the base, the siege ships can rip them apart while the support ship takes care of any smaller enemies. In the case of the Avalon, it can also perform as a support ship due to its AA-heavy turret loadout.\
*\
==Version History==\
* Remodeled in an unknown version.\
*Received a massive buff that increased its Hull and Shield health as well as increasing the turn speed.\
*Buffed in version .66b - received 2 Point Defense Lasers, turn rate increased from 0.04 to 0.09, Shield increased from 3200 to 4500, Hull increased from 3200 to 4000\
*\"Playstyle\" changed in version .66b - Shields reduced from 4500 to 3250, Hull reduced from 4000 to 3500, received a new turret/medium flaks switched for a different Turret.\
*Remodeled in version .66n\
*9 Huge Cannons downsized to Large Cannons in version .69a1.\
*Hull increased from 3500 to 5250, Shield increased from 3250 to 4250, Cargo Hold Increased 300 from 375, Acceleration/Turn Speed increased from 5/0.10 to 9/0.13; spinals removed, replaced with four medium torpedoes; Turret Loadout changed: 2 Heavy Flak Cannons, 1 Heavy LR Laser, 1 Heavy Point Defence Laser, 2 Capital Lasers replaced with 1 Heavy Railgun, 5 Triple Heavy Cannons, 1 Heavy LR Laser; Explosion Size increased. All in version .72d4.\
*Topside Triple Heavy Cannon downgraded to Dual Medium Cannon, spinal arrangement changed to a \"shotgun\" pattern in version .72d4.\
*Torpedo count reduced from 4 to 3, pattern changed from shotgun in version .72d4.\
*Cargo Hold increased from 375 to 800 in version .72d4.\
*Price increased in version .72e1\
*Explosion Size 230 ----> 580 .75a12\
*4x Triple Heavy Cannon ----> 4x Heavy Flak Cannon 1x Heavy Railgun ----> Heavy Point Defence Laser 1x Heavy LR Laser ----> Heavy Point Defence Laser 1x Dual Medium Cannon ----> Heavy Point Defence Laser 3 Large Torpedo ----> 3 Huge Torpedo Shield 4750 ----> 4000 Hull 5250 ----> 4000 Torp interval ----> 1.25 .75a20\
==Trivia==\
*The ship's name was recommended by 11_43x23mm.\
*The Avalon went trough various spinal loadouts all varying between torpedoes and cannons. It originally had 6 small torpedoes and at one point had 9 huge cannons.\
*The original model was based on the Warlock-class destroyer from ''Babylon 5''.\
*Its previous model was often compared to a swordfish.\
*Its back and interior resemble the [[Hasatan]].\
* On the left side upper plate on the frontal area of the ship is written \"BIG SHOT\", mainly as a joke to try to intimidate the enemy.\

==Description ==\
The '''Nyx''' is a large, flat Carrier with a massive health pool and the fourth most [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] in the game. Contrary to what many may believe, the '''Nyx''' has decent firepower for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] but functions leagues better with fighters than without.\
==Interior==\
Upon entering the bridge you will be teleported to an empty black box with the pilots seat and a teleporter back to the dock. A second teleporter will take players to a small but detailed and well-lit fighter bay which contains 8 [[Nixesion]]s.\
==Advantages==\
*Extremely high firepower from the [[Nixesion]] [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Large cargo hold. (1000)\
*Relatively large explosion value of 410 (4.1k stud radius) can easily destroy all smaller ships in range, and even some smaller [[:Category:Capital Ship|capital ships]], provided their health has been sufficiently crippled first.\
*Decent [[Turrets|Turret]] firepower.\
*The fighters alone possess incredible combined firepower far exceeding that of the [[Prototype X-2]], and the '''Nyx''' has enough turret firepower to defend itself against most ships even without the use of its fighters.\
==Disadvantages ==\
*Players can easily swarm an undefended '''Nyx.'''\
*Very large.\
*Tied with many other ships, such as the [[Prototype X-1]] and [[Ridgebreaker]] as the slowest ship in the game.\
* '''Very''' expensive compared to other [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]]. \
*'''Massive''' explosion size could result in death towards friendly ships. (410 radius)\
*Can easily be destroyed by multiple [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*This ship requires multiple people to properly protect and use to deal proper damage.\
*Unreliable without AI Fighters.\
*Expensive. \
\
* Inexperienced pilots will have a hard time piloting some [[Nixesion]]s out of the hangar of the '''Nyx''' due to the edges of the wings being clipped inside of part of the hangar itself.\
*Many blind spots due to the size of the ship.\
*\
==Strategy==\
*'''Always''' travel in a fleet to ensure maximum effectiveness.\
* Make sure you have a team that will listen to you so they can teleport on board to pilot the [[Nixesion]]s.\
*Bait and Switch: Warp Into a dangerous zone, tell pilots to enter the [[Nixesion]]s and then warp out of the zone leaving the [[Nixesion]]s to deal with whatever you encountered.\
* When attacking this ship, warp as fast as possible away from the explosion to avoid becoming nuked.\
*A '''Nyx''' at [[War]] with multiple factions will almost always gather a fleet with the purpose of defeating it.\
*Avoid AA ships s<nowiki/>uch as the [[Mjolnheimr]] or [[Ampharos]] - their accurate turrets will shred your fighters.\
* If the enemy faction is sieging, try to use your own fighters to defend the base.\
*Though the '''Nyx''' is capable of tanking, always be ready to escape or despawn, as being dived could easily lead to death due to the '''Nyx's''' low mobility and firepower. Never overestimate the vessel's health.\
==Version History==\
*As of December 20, 2021 the Nyx requires 8 Armored Platings.\
*Buffed in version .64c to add 2 [[Turrets|Medium Lasers]] and 2 [[Turrets|Light Gatling Cannons]].\
*Received a remodel in version .66l, fighter count reduced from 12 to 8.\
*Buffed in Carrier Rebalance on July 25, 2020: Health increased from 12500/10000 to 15000/11000, 2 Light Gatling Cannons and Medium Lasers replaced with 4 Heavy Point Defense Lasers and 2 Heavy Flak Cannons in version .68d.\
*Top Speed increased from 15 to 50 and Turn Speed increased from 0.03 to 0.1 in version .70c1, along with every other ship that had less than 50 Top Speed and less than 0.1 Turn Speed.\
*Remodeled, turret armament changed from 4 Heavy Flak Cannons and 2 Heavy Point Defence Lasers, to 8 Dual Medium Lasers; explosion value increased from 410 to 1250, speed increased from 45 to 70, turn speed increased from 0.1 to 0.11, and acceleration buffed from 5 to 12, Nixesion amount changed from 8 to 12, and cargo hold reduced from 1000 to 300, in version .74b14.\
*As of 2/6/2022, the nyx fighter count was reduced to 9 from 12. \
*As of 3/01/2022, nyx fighter count was reduced to 8 from 9.\
==Trivia==\
*One of the most-used carriers in the game, mainly due to its nuking capability and extreme health distribution.\
* Originally had no turrets.\
*In the newest update, it and the [[Borealis]] received turrets.<sup>(When?)</sup>\
*This original ship is based on the Gallente Federation Supercarrier [http://eve.wikia.com/wiki/Nyx Nyx], in Eve Online.\
*Came out during the [[Galaxy Star Wars Event|Rogue One event]].\
*It used to be the bulkiest ship in game before the [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]] came out.\
*This ship was one of the 5 chosen to be remodeled for the [[Halloween Event 2017]], with its remodel, the [[Ghoul Nyx]], being a stronger, transparent version of the original.\
*'''Nyx''' was the Greek goddess of Night and Darkness.\
*Largest ship upon release.\
*Was the most expensive non-event ship in the build menu until [[Prometheus]] came out, save for a short period of time upon the release of the [[Borealis]] in which the [[Borealis]] costed more, nowadays, [[Borealis]] along with [[Nimitz]], [[Prometheus]] and [[Revelation]] are more expensive than it.\
*The original model had a rather detailed interior, with it even including a cafeteria room. Sadly, it was eventually removed due to lag.\
*The [[Borealis]] and [[Prometheus]] were both released as more costly than the Nyx, and were both intended to be stronger than the '''Nyx'''(and all other [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]]) upon their release, but despite that, the '''Nyx''' has remained the most powerful and reliable non-limited carrier since it was released originally.\

The '''''Deity''''' is an extremely maneuverable [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] that is extremely adept at brawling against other capital ships.\
== Description ==\
The '''Deity''' is an extremely large [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]], but despite its size, it is fast and agile and capable of dishing out large amounts of damage, making it excellent for combat against other capital ships.\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Deity''' is a mid-sized [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] that has a similar shape to the [[Oblivion]], with an extremely long forked shape front. The ship contains many detailing similar to other ships in [[Event Horizon]], with striped platings that correspond to team color lining the ship. The back of the ship features many engines and a large ring at the middle. Despite the middle of the ship being hollow and similar to that of a large spinal barrel, the Deity does not use any sort of spinal whatsoever.\
\
The Interior consists of two rooms, one is the bridge found in the middle of the ship, and one is the lounge, found at the bottom of the ship. The bridge consists of a large control center, with the pilot seat in the middle, along with an illustration of the ship. A meeting room is found with a large table and adjacent to it are the doors that lead outside the ship and the other leading to the lounge room. The lounge room is mainly made of glass, making it similar to an observatory, with a bar in the middle and seats on the front.\
== Advantages==\
*Fantastic for PvP against other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] and especially [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]].\
*Has turn speed that is better than many [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]].\
*Has the highest mobility and speed in its class.\
*Turrets have good accuracy and extremely fast reload, allowing it to mow down enemy ships easily.\
*Has high turret-based firepower.\
==Disadvantages==\
*No [[Turrets]] underneath the ship, making it an easy target for swarms of smaller ships.\
*Low hull damage output compared to shields.\
*2nd lowest total health out of any [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]], only beaten by [[Theia]].\
*Rather low health and limited range makes it an inappropriate ship for sieging.\
*Has difficulty hitting ships that are smaller than a [[:Category:battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
*Like most large ships, it has a lot of surface area where it can be easily shot. This is somewhat balanced by the relatively high speed of this ship.\
==Strategy==\
*It is not a good idea to siege with this ship because of its below average health and limited range.\
*Never travel alone unless you are absolutely certain you will not lose it.\
*If you are up against a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]], try to get under them and behind them so you can take it down while minimizing damage from their main, heavy-hitting Turrets.\
*This ship is best used in a fleet, as providing cover for it can make it maximize it's potential, and lessens the chance of getting [[Galaxy Slang|dived]].\
*Avoid attempting to engage multiple small ships at once. The ship is capable, but like many other ships in its class; it suffers from less than ideal accuracy on its turrets, and is highly vulnerable to swarming because of it.\
*Keep large ships in your line of fire by taking advantage of your quick speed and good maneuverability.\
*When fighting against large ships such as other [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]] or [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], take advantage of your superior mobility and warp underneath them.\
*This ship is great at [[Galaxy Terminology|diving]], so use that to your advantage.\
==Version History ==\
* Added in version .65b\
* Turn speed buffed from 0.08 to 0.1 in version .66b\
*Remodeled in .66b\
*Disabled in .66b along with the other Super Capitals due to weapon part/alien device duping\
*Reactivated in .66b shortly after being disabled but now with a credit cost\
*Received an orange trail in .66c\
*Turret loadout changed to 2 Huge Double Laser, 2 Capital Triple Cannon, 1 Huge Triple Cannon, 2 Capital Triple Laser, 1 Quantum Cannon, and 1 Heavy Flak Cannon in version .72b. Shield and hull increased to 10500 shield and 12500 hull in version .72b\
*Reactivated in .72b with a new cost: Now requires 1 SC permit and regular build materials\
*Version 72f: loadout changed—3 Huge Quad Lasers; 4 Heavy Quantum Lasers; 2 Huge Triple Cannons; 1 Triple Heavy Quantum Cannon; Deity turnspeed lowered to 0.2\
*Turnspeed increased to 0.22, Two Huge Quad Lasers swapped for Two Huge Triple Lasers in version .72f\

''Rocket for short.'' Past Galaxy Administrator and Galaxy Admin Director since 2021<br />\
<[[User:Rocket Raccoon|Galaxypedia Account]]>\
__TOC__\
==Story (Written by Rocket himself)==\
Hello I am Rocket, defender of the galaxy with a small known gang, Guardians of the Galaxy.\
\
Came to Earth one day on July 2017 and saw some lil' gargoyles on a Terran webpage called Roblox.\
\
Never knew what that is 'til I tried it out myself. I have to say, it's weird- you know. All yea humies spend hours staring at some screen doin' some crazy shit and business. So I thought to myself, \"Why not I try it?\" Not like saving the galaxy is important right now.\
\
Here I am, created an account called Rocket_GotG and found a game called 'Galaxy', yep. First thing I searched on Roblox is literally 'Galaxy', quite a coincidence really. Some random Terran game, that turns out to be ENJOYABLE. I normally blast people to pieces who pisses me off, but eh. After a while, I learned how to be...'different', you know- Stop being a pain in the backside to everyone. Sure, I blasted a few ships here and there whenever I am in a bad mood, but really. I collect ships, no joke. I have a massive COLLECTION of ships in my inventory over the years of Galaxy I played, I haven't missed ONE event once, ok that's actually a lie. I only missed out the 2019 April fools. I didn't get the Prototype X-3 'cause...I lost my original Grim in like March, I haven't told anyone about it, but it's the first time I actually had quit Galaxy for 6 months, only came back to do 4th of july event. I didn't stop there. During my time I quit galaxy I was a moderator on the Galaxy Discord. Was pretty active at the time because I didn't play much on Roblox ever since I lost Grim.\
\
To me, losing that Grim is what brought me up to be an Admin, high activity during my moderator era, not only that but respectful to the community as a whole.\
\
It's all began on August, 15th I think, don't get my words on it, but it's that month where I really stepped up and agreed with Confinium's terms of hiring me to be an Admin for the game, Galaxy. Although I got demoted for kicking a player without any evidence few days later.\
\
I got upset and created a new private server on Galaxy called \"Isolation Zone\", it's where I spent my days, alone filled with regret, I saw the evidence in front of me, but I didn't take it. That was on me, I know that. I thought I never have the chance to ever return. Then a bright spark came to me when Head of Staff, purpledazee DMed me, asking if I would rejoin staff again. I said \"yes\" and purple got me back on the team again. From this moment one. I made sure I won't make another mistake or fail Confinium during his era of Admin Director. Wasn't until he decided to blackmarket Galaxy, selling t-shirts at high number of Robux for in-game ships so he could make enough Robux to hire developers for his own game, though sadly never pressed forward. Was a hard on me and the staff to keep our positions without an Admin Director, 'til one of the oldest staff member, 1_Fast stood up in front of the spotlight and became the new AD during the early 2020 onwards, he made changes but he wasn't very corrupt either. 1_Fast is more generous and respectful to the staff and the community than Confinium ever was. Sadly...as time moves forward the old staff I knew began to fade as new ones raise from the surface, I never had issues with the new staff but I missed the old ones, 'til I became the oldest Admin left during 1_Fast's Admin Director Era.\
\
As time passes by, 1_Fast resigned in Early 2021, Early March. Another hard push on me and staff yet again, unlike last time, I knew what was coming, I knew how to adapt ever since Confinium was gone. Irfaan1997 kept the staff going 'acting AD' at the time, though because Irfaan wasn't exactly part of the admin team back then. rcouret preferred to select a new AD from the current staff team in the day, although no one was AD for around a week or two, I certain it's been a while, then when I met rcouret. I told him more about myself and sworn an oath to him that I'd do better than the previous Admin Directors, and that I currently the oldest staff around which also got him to believe that I am well enough experience to bring me this very moment, a moment of which I became an Admin Director on 25th of March.\
\
At first, I wanted to keep 1_Fast's system, but then I realised that his system is not what the community want, over the following months I have recreated the mod guide to show more clarity but it's all based on the old rules, just expanded to help the staff team to moderate accordingly to the book. It's not what the community want. You see, unlike any other ADs, I put the community first, that began more apparent in later months around November is when I opened myself up to the community, but that changed didn't on it's own. SmokeyJoe38 (aka Jaxumi92) came up with ideas on how the community should be handled in a way that the moderation isn't to strict but also ensure that the staff are outside of corruption to keep the community and staff safe. I would've approved said change a long time ago, but I couldn't because during those times purpledazee still Head of Staff, wasn't until she banned some trial moderators which got RC's attention to remove her from Head of Staff, which once again put a hard push on me and the staff team but because I am AD, I kept pressing on without purple. WHEN I came back on Jaxumi92's DMs again and saw his list, then I stared at the community, reading messages people posts; the harassment, the drama, the riots, the disagreement with the rules. I know that being an AD isn't all about myself. I didn't see myself as a king or emperor, I see myself as an individual equal to everybody else in the community, I stared down, being in the community's shoes, the fear they all gone through having to deal with strict rules on a server that is 13+ of age, I know that isn't right. What's worst is when uglycar called me a 'Bad AD', referring me as every other ADs who didn't see any similarities they have with the community. I did, I want uglycar back to continue developing because I care about Galaxy, and I care for the community.\
\
This day forward. I wanted to be the first AD to make that change possible, to give the community their freedom that old ADs had taken away. Let me be the one to help you, let the community to decide how the rules should play. As long it doesn't break Discord's ToS.\

{{Image_Infobox}}\
'''''Aqueous II '''''is the second [[:Category:Planets|Planet]] to be added to Galaxy after the removal of [[Earth]].\
== Description ==\
'''Aqueous''' '''II''' has a blue atmosphere surrounding it and is similar to the planet [[Frion I]]. Though the planet is initially unarmed, it receives [[Turrets]] when upgraded to Level 2 or 3. Players used to be able to start the [[Christmas Event 2020|Christmas Quest]] here. '''Aqueous II''' can have up to 10,000 shield and hull once fully upgraded. Level 1 costs 12,000 credits and level 2 costs 24,000 credits. The planet's base is accessed through a small shelter built within a cave. The planet's surface is covered in snow and ice, and the planet is buffeted by a raging blizzard, adding to the beautiful winter aesthetic. As of version .62c, '''Aqueous II''' has a ring-like belt of asteroids in close orbit. Most are made out of [[Ores|Palladium]] or [[Ores|Iridium ore]]. As of version .62d, some of these asteroids can be mined. The profit from mining all of the ore around the planet is typically between 20 and 25 thousand credits.\
\
Whenever a team's [[Territory]] expands over the planet, the ownership of '''Aqueous II''' will be transferred to that team. When sieging '''Aqueous II''', the final hit will take the base in the same manner as [[Frion I]] and [[Myriad III]].\
\
As of version .70c, the planet is now a bright neon blue-white color, and its atmosphere has become frozen and non-collidable. The spawn and dock location has been moved to a white [[Corvid]] stationed below the remaining asteroid. A cage labeled as \"Terminal B\" is attached to this ship, allowing one (?) ship to dock at a time and allowing all other normal base functions.\
\
== Interior ==\
The interior of '''Aqueous II''' is made up of a large floating island divided into two levels, as well as a cave. The top sides of both levels house a variety of structures and objects. The bottom \"level\" features a large lab-like building that houses various rooms with unknown purpose. This level is also home to the [[The Ice Monster|Ice Monster]], a currently unused quest NPC. The docks for '''Aqueous II''' are also located here, which at level one are simple platforms with no teleporter. The inside of the shelter has some Alien text.\
\
When the planet is upgraded to level two or three, the shelter gains a much more industrial appearance with large metal structures and laser-beam gates. It also gains new Alien text on the inside of the building. The docks also gain a more metallic appearance and have teleporters nearby.\
\
The top level of the island includes derelict buildings and [[Turrets]], with various rocks and trees in the area to suggest the planet has been long abandoned. When upgraded to level two or three, this area gains an energy tower with Alien text on one side.\
\
There is also a small cave below the location of the shelter. This cave is a small complex containing a snowman and various other objects. Players can enter this cave through small crack in the rocks on the bottom of '''Aqueous II'''.\
\
== Quests ==\
'''Aqueous II''' is the home of two current quest NPCs and one former quest NPC.\
\
=== Kendall Research Station - Quest #8 ===\
Among '''Aqueous II's '''ring-like belt of asteroids is a small station containing the [[Monogram]], a semi-transparent quest NPC. This NPC gives players Quest #8, which requires the collection of 7 Ascension Crystals for a 10,000 credit reward. This quest is currently one of the only repeatable quests in Galaxy.\
\
=== Kneall Harbor Master - Quest #6 ===\
Rumor has it that the Kneall were involved in the mysterious evacuation of Aqueous II. Apparently, one of their kind stayed behind to salvage funds for their empire from any traveler that discovers them. The [[Kneall Harbor Master]] offers players the [[Prototype X-2]] in exchange for 2 million credits to continue funding of the Kneall empire. Clues to the exact location of this NPC can be found through various Alien scripts located on the planet.\
\
=== Ice Monster - Discontinued Quest ===\
The [[The Ice Monster|Ice Monster]] (or Yeti) was a quest NPC for the [[Christmas Event 2017|Christmas 2017 Quest]], which involved collecting snowflakes in a trade to acquire the [[Blizzard]], a unique [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]]. After the Christmas event ended, the quest was disabled and [[Snowflake]]s no longer spawn, but the Ice Monster remains a permanent figure on the surface of '''Aqueous II'''.\
\
== Climate ==\
The climate of '''Aqueous II''' is mostly boreal, the planet is always coated in snow and it is always snowing. The planet does support life, mostly trees however.\
\
== Version History ==\
* Added in version .59i during the [[Christmas Event 2017]].\
* Remodeled and Buffed in .60d. Now can be upgraded to level 3 with max health of 20k (10k shield and 10k planet hull). Remodeled buildings, new teleporters, and more.\
* Received new \"orbital\" [[Turrets]] in .62a that replaced the mounted [[Turrets]]. The planet has 5 at level 2 and 10 turrets at level 3.\
* Received an asteroid belt / ring in .62c and became the home of Quest #8.\
* Became broken and destroyed after the Antares comet crashed into it during the Christmas event 2020\
* Atmosphere made non-collidable and neon-white as the planet \"froze over\" in version .70c; added a [[Corvid]] as a replacement spawn/dock location\
\
== Trivia ==\
* It's the third planet ever added behind [[Frion I]] and [[Earth]]. (The latter of which was removed).\
* It's where the [[The Ice Monster|Ice Monster]] was located.\
* The bottom level has enough room for certain [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] and smaller [[Ships]] to fit inside.\
* There is a cat decal easter egg placed by the creator due to obligations to a friend.\
* If looked at from the right angle, the planet appears to be an oval shape.\
* The Alien text scattered throughout the planet holds a secret related to the [[Prototype X-1|Proto]][[Prototype X-2|type]] Quests and the [[Kneall Harbor Master]].\
* An unusual amount of [[Ores]], specifically Palladium spawn around Aqueous II's ring, that can grow so large that it cannot be mined by the [[M Class]].\
* Like the other planets, Aqueous II starts with lower economy than player [[starbase]]s.\
*The Antares comet crashed onto Aqueous II during 2020 Christmas event and offers a battleship, Crystocrene for 75 snowflakes and 150,000 credits.\
*As Aqueous II revamp was already being made during 2020, the actual base of the level 1 '''Aqueous II''' was used in the [[Halloween Event 2020]] as one of the dimensions [[The Rift]] was able to lead a player to. It was where you could purshase [[Black Scarab]] for 500 [[Gamma Pumpkin]] and 5 [[Void Pumpkin]] along 500k credits.\

==Description==\
(For U.N.E Lore Click '''[[U.N.E Lore|HERE]]''') \
\
'''''The U.N.E''''' are one of the only three [[:Category:AI|AI]] Factions in the game, the other two being the [[Pirates]] and the [[Kneall]]/[[Aliens]]. The U.N.E is also the only AI Faction in the game that is passive towards players. \
\
The U.N.E's base of operations is a [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] called the [[U.N.E Starbase]] and has a navy blue color along with the territory it occupies. \
\
Any ships affiliated with the U.N.E faction will have a Navy Blue color to them and will attack any ship that is affiliated with [[Pirates]] or [[Aliens]], at a minimum of 13,000 studs away from them. \
\
New players who have just started playing Galaxy will be automatically be joined inside the U.N.E faction so as to have protection from [[Pirating]]. \
\
'''Notes:'''\
*''U.N.E cannot have a player leader and cannot be warred by any factions, no matter the circumstances.''\
*''U.N.E Starbases and ships '''DO NOT''' spawn in private servers and only do spawn in public servers.'' \
*''U.N.E Starbases can assimilate NPC Bases but '''NOT''' Player Starbases.''\
*''Strangely, the U.N.E Starbase can be assimilated, given enough territory from a faction.''\
==U.N.E Fleet==\
The U.N.E ships that currently spawn naturally are the following: \
{{ShipLink|Chimera-S}}\
{{ShipLink|Sovereign-X}}\
{{ShipLink|Orion-X}}\
The U.N.E ships that currently don't spawn naturally are the following: \
{{ShipLink|U.N.E. Nisos}}\
{{ShipLink|Judgement}}\
{{ShipLink|U.N.E Subjugator}}\
*Small [[Chimera-S]] ships spawn in groups of 3-5 at random locations on the map.\
*Capital U.N.E ships used to spawn and patrol at the [[U.N.E Starbase]] and the [[Mega Base]].\
*All U.N.E ships, from the [[Chimera-S]], all the way to the [[U.N.E Subjugator]] have the ability to call all U.N.E Ships currently in the map to their aid, and can target [[Aliens|Alien]] [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]] and [[:Category:Planets|Planets]].\

The '''''Slipstream''''' is a fast and maneuverable [[Slarfie]] [[:Category:Dreadnought|'''Dreadnought''']] with a focus on speed and turret firepower.\
== Description ==\
What the '''Slipstream''' lacks in shield integrity it makes up for with sheer [[Hull]] strength. Its speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.top_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = '{{PAGENAME}}'}} makes it faster than all other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] in the game excluding the [[SR-71]]. This ship's speed and decent firepower makes it great for being a multipurpose ship. All these combined, the Slipstream can be used as a multi-role ship like other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships.]]\
\
== Appearance ==\
The Slipstream is the tallest ship in the game, and also one of the thinnest capital ships. It features a large fin on top of the ship, as well as an even larger one on the bottom, and has many orbital turrets around the ship. The ship sports a unique color palette with orange-yellow and blue detailing around the ship. In the middle, there can be text in Alien Language that says <span style=\"color:#FFAE42\">\"Peace For All\"</span>.\
\
The Interior is pretty simple, having a cockpit and two terminals at the right and left side of the pilot's seat and a hologram in front of the seat. There are also a few decorative elements.\
[[File:Peaceforall.png|thumb|<span style=\"color:#FFAE42\">\"''Peace For all''\"</span>|none]]\
== Advantages  ==\
*The highest turret DPS of any [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] at {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turret_dps|where=ShipData._pageName = '{{PAGENAME}}'}}, close to [[Deity]]'s DPS of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turret_dps|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Deity'}}.\
*[[Turrets]] have good placement and a decent line of sight and can shoot behind the ship.\
*One of the fastest [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] at {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.top_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = '{{PAGENAME}}'}} max speed, faster than most [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and even some [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]].\
*High [[Hull]] health, making it strong against shield-breakers.\
*Versatile [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] to dive ships with, having high firepower and speed to chase its target.\
*High turn speed for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
*Very versatile for a Dreadnought, It can chase hulled ships, being a support in sieging [[Starbase]]s, and fighting other Capital Ships.\
*Can outmaneuver most Dreadnoughts, making it useful in PvP as well.\
== Disadvantages ==\
*Weak [[Shields]] compared to [[Hull]], making it susceptible to hull-breakers like the [[Ridgebreaker]].\
*Tall build makes it easier for [[Spinals]] to land a hit on the ship vertically. However, this can be fixed by turning the ship sideways.\
*Difficult for all [[Turrets]] to fire at once unless pointing directly in front of the target.\
*Low accuracy for most of its weapons.\
*Has difficulty docking if other large [[ships]] are under it.\
*[[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] ship on a limited rotation, meaning it will be expensive and cannot be re-obtained until it is back in rotation.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use the excellent [[Turrets|Turret]] Placement and mobility to fight other [[Ships]].\
* If you line up correctly with an enemy ship chasing you, the chances to hit it at 100% speed will Increase.\
* Use this to chase down [[Ships]] and miners to abuse its powerful speed and damage.\
* You can [[Galaxy Slang|drift]] at full speed by turning your ship 90 Degrees at full speed then pressing Z or C, depending on your drifting direction.\
* When going against [[Spinals|Spinal]] focused ships, exploit their requirement to travel and keep a long distance to dodge the [[Spinals]] with its speed, while picking away at the enemy's health.\
*Avoid large groups of skilled [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]], as just 3 [[Aeaphiel]]s can heavily damage or even destroy you.\
*Always keep an eye on your health, this ship is extremely expensive, and you might not afford losing it.\
*Use the excellent maneuverability to dodge the fire of stronger PvP ships that require their spinals to deal damage.\
*Try not to use it as a flagship in sieges, it can’t tank for very long and has mostly low range turrets. Instead use it to fight off defensive enemy ships or to support heavy sieging ships.\
*Easily pirate defenseless miners and freighters with the speed and turret firepower.\
*2-3 of these, much like the triple [[Osiris]], can easily cut down dreadnoughts and fight against most [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]]. Don't be afraid to take on lone dreadnoughts, though stay vigilant as lone dreadnoughts may be a bait.\
== Version History ==\
* Hull buffed from 6150 to 7150 and turn speed increased from 0.07 to 0.1 in .65b.\
* Turn speed increased to 0.19 from 0.1 in .65b.\

*Explosion Size 1000 ----> 850 .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*The first vertically oriented ship in the game.\
*Resembles the [https://eve.wikia.com/wiki/Myrmidon Myrmidon] and Naglfar from EVE Online.\
*Often referred to as the \"Slipmeme\" \
*The Alien text on the side of the Ship says \"PEACE FOR ALL\" despite the Slipstream being a deadly [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]].\
*One of the few vertical ships along with the [[Ampharos]], [[Mjolnheimr]], [[Khapri]] and [[Halkaryak]].\
*Turned into an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]] for reasons unknown.\

''These are not exactly rules, but tips that players may want to consider. Based off of the tips in [[Ship Loss]].''\
<h1>Be able to afford a loss</h1>\
*Never fly a ship (especially with cargo inside) you can’t afford to lose during war unless you know how to deal with dangerous situations such as being dived by a powerful ship. Always check the minimap for signs of enemy ships and be more cautious when using limited ships.\
*You should know when it is a good or a bad time to fly your ship for any reason. For example, if you are at war with a faction that is likely to pirate, do not mine or trade in expensive ships unless you feel certain you can escape if you’re dived.\
<h1>Never [[Mining|Mine]] during a war</h1>\
*Do not '''Mine''' during a war, many miners have lost their ships to [[pirating|Pirates]] because of this. Not even if you need a quick credit boost. It’s very easy to lose even the tankiest of [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] when at war with a powerful faction. If you are mining during war, make sure to check the map often for enemies and warp back to your base if even one ship spawns and points towards you. If you are quick enough it is easy to avoid destruction, but always be careful, and preferably don’t mine during war in the first place.\
<h1>Never [[Trading|Trade]] during a war</h1>\
*This is the equivalent to mining during a war. Never '''Trade''' during a war with a larger or more experienced faction, as many [[Pirating|pirates]] will likely be around where you wish to loot or sell your loot. An exception is when using extremely cheap [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] such as the [[Tempura]] or [[Prospector]], but any loot you collected will be lost unless you manage to loot your own wreck.\
*This is a common strategy for [[Pirating|pirates]] to gain [[credits]]/[[bounty]]. As pirates can return to your wreck with a freighter of their own and an escort to loot whatever was in your cargo hold. In some cases they may not need to change ships since pirate ships like the [[Helios]] usually have a high cargo hold.\
*Freighter pirating usually happens around [[Mega Base]]. A ship such as the Nightmare can even spawn at Mega Base immediately for a surprise attack, usually leading to ship destruction.\
<h1>Avoid going to [[Mega Base]] if you're at [[War]], as [[Pirating|pirates]] normally attack there</h1>\
* '''Pirates''' can camp at '''Mega Base''' to attack unsuspecting ships that come there.\
* If you are aware that '''Pirates''' in your current server travel to '''Mega Base''' often, be careful.\
* Some factions may also choose to blockade '''Mega Base''', to prevent opposing ships from fleeing. \
* To reduce your chances of being a victim to '''Pirates''', remember to check the minimap often, especially when you are going to '''Mega Base''' or have a lot of loot/cargo. \
<h1>Constantly check your [[Minimap]] to see where [[pirating|pirates]] or [[Aliens]] may be</h1>\
*The '''Minimap''' is there to assist you, use it to your advantage. Look for enemies of any kind and learn to estimate distances based on where objects are in relation to each other. This can be extremely important for warping properly to things you can’t see or looking for danger.\
<h1>Experience matters!</h1>\
*You're in this game for the long run. Don't expect to do anything meaningful on the first day playing, or ever.\
*Don't let [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] or other big ships overwhelm you, as most can be destroyed easily using an experienced fleet.\
*Take your time learning about the game and asking for help from other players, knowledge of the game is very important for playing.\
*Always know which ships you’re dealing with. Know which ones are slow, fast, hull tanks, shield tanks, have high or low DPS, etc.\
*There will always be a bigger fish, someone who is more skilled, richer, or more connected than you. You may not be the best, but you can be your best.\
<h1>Bigger is not always better</h1>\
*More expensive ships are not always better ships, they may also make a bigger target.\
*Better ships can usually cost many times more than a slightly worse ship. Choose wisely.\
*Ships of all sizes have functions to which they are well-suited. For example, small ships may be fast and agile whereas larger ships may be slower and easier to hit.\
*With enough skill and experience, ship size & class really doesn't matter all that much.\
<h1>Unfair circumstances?</h1>\
*There are no fair or unfair fights, the outcome of any fight usually depends entirely on skill and ship choice. The only exception is fights disrupted by normally impossible circumstances or severe lag.\
*Just because you ''can'' fly something doesn't mean you ''should''.\
*The only exception to \"an unfair fight\" would be if you are glitched or getting targeted by an exploiter, both of which scenarios you should contact [[Galaxy Staff]] about.\
*Always expect every possibility, from an enemy spawning a dangerous ship to a 1v1 being completely changed by other players joining the fight.\
<h1>You will lose ships, don't worry!</h1>\
*If you do PvP long enough, you ''will'' lose your ship. It's only a matter of where and when and which (as in which ship).\
*If you leave the game while your ship is still spawned, your ship will remain in space for 2 minutes to which it will then despawn. This timer is stopped if you rejoin within a minute of when you left.\
*Somebody, somewhere has better skill than you, more experience than you, is more clever than you, and can stay online longer than you. \
*At some point, everyone will lose one of their beloved ships. No matter how skilled and clever you are, it happens to everyone, and that's okay.\
*If you lose a ship, don't take your frustration out on the player that killed you, as destroying others ships are a part of the game, if not the point of the game. Instead focus your attention on rebuying the ship or choosing a better ship that may be a better option to use.\
*If you lose ships, usually it is your fault. You may have warped slightly too short or too far, or you may have missed your spinals too many times. Don’t worry about this, since it’s too late already. Instead accept the loss and move on as quickly as possible.\
*Avoid raging or lashing out against other players if you do lose your ship. Acting out your frustration will only dig you into a deeper hole, and possibly end in you being banned. Take a deep breath, calm down, and move on. \
<h1>Practice with [[Warp Drive|Warping]]!</h1>\
*Remember you have 90 seconds between when [[War]] is declared and when you can be attacked.\
*Use that time to get to an allied [[Starbase]] and despawn, if you're in a non-combat ship.\
*Perfect warping is important! It can save your ship in many situations. For example, docking at the nearest friendly base to despawn when being attacked. Overwarping or underwarping can give your enemy plenty of time to finish you off.\
= Private Servers =\
*Even in private servers you may not be safe if you run a open private server or share the code link to anyone outside of your friend group. If you are in your own private server and simply want to gather credits solo, make sure nobody joins.\
*\"PS Baiting\" is a act of using a lure (usually a person who randomly joins and tempts you to spawn a prize ship) and when in a moment of vulnerability (fighting far away from your base) their friends usually join all at once, create new factions, and declare war on your faction only. It really is important to practice your warping enough to avoid a ship loss.\
*If you are alone in a private server, large amounts of Aliens and Pirates can accumulate due to there being less bases and less people destroying the ships. Be careful, and learn how to deal with swarms of these ships. One good method is luring a boss to your base in a disposable ship and distracting it while the base deals damage and gains credits.\

''This page is about the player-ownable vessel. If you're looking for the NPC variant, see [[Devastator]].''\
\
The '''''Annihilator''''' is a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] made by the [[Kneall]] for the [[Kneall Event]].\
\
==Description==\
The '''Annihilator''' is a long [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] that is based off the [[Devastator]], but is significantly smaller and has nerfed stats than the ship it is derived from. It carriers 4 Alien themed [[A - Bruiser]] fighters and 1 Unique battleship fighter, the [[A - Brawler]].\
==Appearance==\
The Annihilator is a long, slender carrier that has an almost identical appearance to the Devastator. It is one of the largest alien ships in the game, rivalling the size of the [[Prototype X-2]]. There are 2 teleporters, one leading to the interior and bridge of the ship, one leads to the fighter bay.\
\
The <u>'''Fighter Bay'''</u> is a long hangar housing 4 [[A - Bruiser]] fighters, and at the end of the bay lies the teleporter to the [[A - Brawler]], which lies under the ship.\
\
The <u>'''Interior'''</u> is identical to the interior of the [[Obliterator]], description of the interior is identical to that of the mentioned ship. With the exception of the 2 holograms on the left side. The \"Avoid at all cost pizza\" has been replaced with \"Diagnosis: Skill Issue\" and the kneall mech has been replaced with the face of an ape.\
==Advantages==\
*Has a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] comparable to a battleship.\
*Great for supporting siege fleets with its high health, great fighters, and massive dps.\
*Terrifying power rivaling Super Capitals, for far less cost at the time of the event.\
*High [[Hull]] damage.\
*The fighters possess incredible combined firepower if used in a swarm, and even more so if the carrier itself is supporting it.\
*Has more firepower by itself than most non limited [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*High total health of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.hull|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Annihilator'}} Hull and {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.shields|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Annihilator'}} Shields, comparable to a weak [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]].\
*Massive total damage output when combined with [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Very powerful unique fighters.\
*It has an explosion radius of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.explosion_radius|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Annihilator'}}, rivaling that of [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] nukes and can '''destroy full shield [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]'''.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Rather low [[Shields|Shield]] damage compared to [[Hull]] damage.\
*Sluggish turn speed.\
*Limited carrier, making you a large target.\
*Struggles to fire all turrets at once, unless pointing directly at its target. (Even then, some turrets can still be blocked)\
* Similar to other obtainable [[Kneall]] [[:Category:Capital Ship|capital ships]], the turrets have rather poor accuracy.\
*Its extremely powerful nuke will be a threat to your own fleet/team when your ship is destroyed.\
== Strategy==\
* Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.\
*'''NEVER''' use this ship for tanking damage. The expense of it alone makes it a massive target.\
*It can be used as a support [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] in sieges by carrying [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to distract enemy [[Starbase]]s, as well as providing great support from its Battleship-like fighter.\
* Useful in fleets, as it provides a powerful and disposable Fighter.\
*Get a player pilot in the [[A - Brawler]] rather than using an [[AI Fighters]] slot for it as a player could make use of the fighter's full potential.\
*When fighting with the Annihilator, try and stay pointed to your opponent so all your turrets have a line of sight.\
*Be aggressive when you must engage in combat. Due to the low range nature of Annihilator's turrets, not being able to fire the first shot will put you in a disadvantage.\
*Try not to engage when you don't have fighters. This ship is only extremely powerful when paired with its fighters.\
*If you think your ship will be destroyed, Warp your ship away as '''far as possible''' from your own fleet or starbase as the nuke has a whopping radius of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.explosion_radius|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Annihilator'}}, and if possible, you can warp to the enemy's fleet or starbase to bring the nuke there instead.\
==Version History ==\
*Added in version .75a10\
*No longer obtainable & Turret DPS slightly nerfed (Titan Kneall Cannon cooldown 2.8s -> 3s) after the end of the [[Kneall Event]]. Received an ambience as well.\
*Interior received a shadow-update in an unknown version (most likely same version as the previous entry). \"Avoid at all cost pizza\" hologram has been replaced with a \"Diagnosis: Skill Issue\" poster and the Kneall Mech hologram has been replaced with a picture of the face of an ape.\
*Was added to the Limited Build Menu after the conclusion of the [[Kneall Event]] in version .75a11\
*Made shorter and wider, fixed the issue where you would fall off it .75a12\
*Ambience removed in an unknown version.\
*Received health nerf 14000 Shield -> 11000, 10000 hull -> 9000 in version .75a12\
==Trivia ==\
*It's fighter, The [[A - Brawler]] is an almost identical counterpart to the limited battleship, the [[Brawler]].\
*Used to be obtained in the Non-Limited Build menu, It's main item, The Annihilator Blueprint, could be made in the quest [[Reverse Engineering]].\
*One of the few playable ships of 100% Kneall design in-game, the others being the [[Prototype X-2]], the [[Brawler]] and the [[Obliterator]].\
*One of the only 2 [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] to house a Battleship like fighter: The [[A - Brawler]], while the other carrier being [[Hevnetier]] and it's fighter, the [[Elanis]].\
*One of the highest DPS carriers in the game, tied with the [[Hailstorm]] and [[Sakala]]. ''(without fighters)''\
*Used to be one of the only ships with an ambience. In fact, it is the only Carrier that used to have one, and had the loudest and longest range ambience out of every other ship.\
*Used to have the second most expensive material cost in the game, requiring a blueprint from the quest [[Reverse Engineering]] and materials totaling at 1.9 Million, only behind [[Lucifer]] and the [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]].\
*The first person to lose an '''Annihilator''' was skinnidafam to an Alien [[Devastator]].\
*There used to be a flagship plan for Annihilator, which sought to make Annihilator's health 14000/10000 and give it even more powerful turrets, fully pushing it into the Super Capital range. However, it was eventually cancelled and the Annihilator received a permanent health nerf.\

The '''''Subjugator''''' is a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|'''Super Capital Ship''']] capable of tanking monstrous amounts of damage and still come out smiling.\
\
== Description ==\
The '''Subjugator''' is an incredibly sturdy and tanky [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|'''Super Capital Ship''']] ship, able to soak huge amounts of damage for a long time.\
\
This ship excels at being a flagship in a fleet due to its extreme durability, and is versatile at giving the enemy pressure during sieges or fleet battles.\
== Appearance ==\
The Subjugator is extremely large and one of the longest ships in the game, containing many large weapons.\
It has a smooth and militaristic design that is similar to the [[Nisos]], with multiple large platings all around the ship. It has a long body with [[Turrets]] lined along its top and bottom, along with multiple [[United Nations of Earth|U.N.E.]] flags located throughout the ship. Its most iconic feature are the two [[ShieldSide]] located on each sides of the ship, powered by a shield generator on the middle of the ShieldSides.\
\
The Interior is a round room with 3 screens, one being a hexagonal display, the other being the UNE Flag, and the other having a text that reads: \
<span style=\"color:#76381f\"><span style=\"font-size:15pt\">'''U. N. E.'''</span> ''SUBJUGATOR Class Warship''</span> and a control seat that is similar to the [[Oblivion]] and [[Executioner]].\
== Advantages ==\
* The second highest HP out of any obtainable ship in the game, coming at a monstrous 35000 HP without its [[ShieldSide]]s, only behind the [[Prototype X-1]], at 36500 HP.\
* Can tank abnormal amounts of damage due to its monstrous HP combined with its damage resistance and its [[ShieldSide]].\
* [[Ships]] that have low-damage output have little effect to the ship at all, and even vessels with large Alpha damage take a long time to kill a Subjugator due to its massive health.\
* Many of its vulnerable angles are covered by large unique shields, which can block incoming [[Turrets|Turret]] fire for a decent amount of time, significantly reducing the damage the ship can take.\
* [[ShieldSide]]s have a whopping {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.shields|where=ShipData._pageName = 'ShieldSide'}} health, and both of them equal 17k health, putting '''Subjugator's''' effective total health at around 40,950 HP ''(ShieldSide health scaled down for Super Capital health equivalent)'', if both shields are used in full. This gives it the most effective durability out of any obtainable ship in the game.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Huge, making it an easy target for [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]] and inaccurate turret weaponry.\
* Can be easily swarmed due to having little to no firepower against small ships.\
* Lower Hull damage compared to Shield damage.\
* Due to only having Large and Huge [[Turrets]], it is very difficult to hit small ships.\
* Can only fire all turrets at a broadside angle, making it easier for ships to land spinals.\
* [[ShieldSide]] static [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] are weak to shield-breakers such as the [[Zeus]].\
* Poor damage output for a Super Capital-class ship, being the lowest out of all Super Capitals in the game; which somewhat hinders its ability to destroy other capital ships.\
== Strategy ==\
*Position your '''Subjugator''' well in order to make full use of the ShieldSides, as they act as expendable health.\
* Broadsiding is key for the Subjugator to be used, as most of its turret firepower rely on its sides, as well as taking cover from its [[ShieldSide]].\
* It is not recommended to travel alone in this ship, even with its massive HP.\
* Don't take high value risks, and don't overestimate your massive health, the ship can still be destroyed if swarmed by an experienced team or group of powerful ships.\
* It is very hard to take out small ships with this, so use it for tanking in Sieges or large ships head-on.\
* Utilize the shields to tank extra damage from starbases/large ships, as the shield HP is very beneficial.\
== Version History ==\
* Disabled in .66b along with the other Super Capitals due to weapon part/alien device duplication glitch.\
* Received a turret placement change during the [[Halloween Event 2019|Halloween 2019 Event]].\
* Received a remodel in .66b\
* Reactivated in .66b shortly after being disabled, but now with a credit cost.\
* Buffed/slightly remodeled to add \"shield generators\" in version .69a2.\
*Shields and Turn Speed increased in version .69f.\
*External shields nerfed in an unknown version.\
*Shield projectors buffed moderately in version .72e1; update later reverted?\
*2 more Shield projectors added on each side of the ship respectively in version .72f1.\
*Four more smaller shields with 2.5k health each added in version .73a3.\
*Turn Speed increased from 0.1 to 0.11, loses 2 shields (not the small shields), explosion radius increased to 1300 and re-released onto the build menu in version .73b.\
*Explosion radius reduced to 1000 in an unknown version (only revealed in-game).\
*Explosion radius reverted to 1300 in an unknown version (only revealed in-game).\
*Hull health decreased from 15,000 to 14,500 in version .75a5.\
*Taken off-sale in version .75a5 along with all other build menu super capitals to reduce super capital permit prices.\
*Shield projectors glow added in version .75a5.\
*Shield and Hull health increased from 15,000 respectively to 17,500 respectively (15000/15000 --> 17500/17500 S/H HP) in version .75a37 '''(?)'''.\
== Trivia ==\
{{Picture Infobox Mk II|title1 = Old Photos|image = }}\
* The original model's interior included user [[User:WhyIm|Wiscyy's]] profile picture, commonly used in her builds as a signature.\
* Closely resembles the [https://wiki.star-conflict.com/index.php?title=Invincible Invincible] from the game Star Conflict.\
*It is one of the longest ships in the game.\
*Its latest remodel gave it unique [[ShieldSide|shields]] along each side of the ship that have independent health pools.\
*Has over half as much main (not including auxiliary shield generators) health as the [[Eradicator]].\
*Often considered \"invincible\" due to the large health pool, auxiliary shields, and resistance, which is ironic because the ship it is based on is called the [https://wiki.star-conflict.com/index.php?title=Invincible Invincible].\
*Has an AI variant; The [[UNE Subjugator]], though the variant has no [[ShieldSide]] present on each sides of the ship.\
*The only [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] and non-Carrier in the game that carries \"Fighters\".\

==Description ==\
The '''Prometheus '''is a massive [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] that carries 4 [[Harbinger|Harbingers,]] which are [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]]-sized [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters.]] The ship features two large prongs pointing out of the front. It is the most expensive ship that a player can buy, apart from the [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals,]] [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]], some [[:Category:Limited|Limited Event Ships,]] and some of the [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships.]]\
==Interior ==\
The '''Prometheus''' has a small but detailed interior. There is a set of three teleporters. There is also a pilot seat with control panels, one saying, \"all systems are online.\"\
==Advantages ==\
*Very powerful [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters.]]\
*Great [[Shields|Shield]] firepower with the fighters.\
*Reasonable [[Hull]] firepower for a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
*Has its own unique [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters,]] the [[Harbinger]], which is probably one of the best [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] of any [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]], with their only disadvantage being a lack of sustainability as there are only 4.\
*Massive explosion radius of 800, the highest in the game aside from most limited/advanced dreadnoughts, [[Nimitz]], [[Mothership]] (level 3+), Super Capitals, both Prototypes and [[Kodiak]].\
*Impressive maneuverability for the enormous size, being higher than most [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]].\
*Strong health pool, has the most HP of any build menu carrier.\
==Disadvantages ==\
*Large and has many blind spots, making it a high-profile target.\
*Relatively Mediocre [[Shields|Shield]] firepower without the fighters.\
*Its massive size and high part count may cause lag to the user, as well as the user's teammates.\
*Somewhat difficult for the [[Harbinger]]s to leave the hangar, especially if the pilots are inexperienced or more than one fighter is trying to launch at once.\
*It costs $613,500 credits to upgrade the [[Warehouse]] from level 1 to level 21, which is around $240,000 credits more than a [[Galaxy]].\
*While strong on paper, the combination of turrets, fighters and stats makes for a fairly weak carrier capable of being destroyed by just one or two skilled [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] even with the help of all four [[Harbinger]]s.\
==Strategy ==\
*In a [[Sieging|Siege]] situation, use your massive health pool to tank but be sure to know when to bail (Ideally leave at 1,000 shields).\
*Typically, release your [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] AFTER you engage a [[Starbase]] or a target [[Ships|Ship]]. The Prometheus turret firepower can be countered by the blind spot, so instead you must rely on your massive health pool to keep you alive while you draw the attention of enemies, while your [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] deal heavy damage.\
*Use your 800 explosion radius nuke as a last resort if you know you are going to die.\
== Version History  ==\
*Received trails in version .66b.\
*Shield increased from 10000 to 16000 in version .68d.\
*Price increased in version .69a, exceeding the storage for a Level 32 Warehouse.\
*Cargo Hold increased massively from 2500 to 9000 in version .69a2, which also caused another price increase.\
*Taken off-sale due to unbalanced buy/sell ratio in version .69a2.\
* Hull increased from 10000 to 11250 in version .69e.\
*Re-released on the build menu and turret loadout changed from 4 Point Defence Lasers, 2 Heavy Flak Cannons, 2 Heavy Point Defence Lasers to 3 Heavy Point Defence Laser, 1 Heavy Flak Cannon, and 2 Heavy Railguns. Cargo hold was nerfed from 500 to 300 as well as getting an additional Harbinger, all in version .72f1.\
* Cargo hold increased from 300 to 600, driving up the price of the Prometheus in version .72f1(there was no mention of this in any update log).\
*Top speed increased from 45 to 55, turn speed increased from 0.1 to 0.12, acceleration increased from 15 to 25, fighter teleport position fixed, and turret loadout changed from 3 Heavy Point Defence Lasers, 1 Heavy Flak Cannon, 2 Heavy Railguns to 2 Heavy Point Defence Lasers, 2 Heavy Flak Cannons, and 2 Capital Triple Cannons in version .73b8.\
* Heavy Flak Cannons and Heavy PDLs changed to Super Flak Cannons and Super PDLs in an unknown version (only revealed in-game).\
* [[Herald]] replaced with a fourth [[Harbinger]] in version .75a5\
* Reversed the.73b8 mobility buff in an unknown version \
* As of December 20, 2021 the Prometheus requires 9 Armored Platings.\
* HP nerfed from 14,000 shield --> 8,000 shield, 11,200 hull --> 6,000 hull in version .75a5b.\
*Turrets are now in rows instead of columns .75a12\
==Trivia ==\
*Enormous physical size for a ship, having arguably the largest overall physical size of all ships in the game.\
*Its fighters, 4 [[Harbinger]]s, bear a strong resemblance to the [[Marauder]].    \
*It was given a trail shortly after release.\
*Ended the [[Nyx|Nyx's]] two-year reign as the most expensive non-event [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]].\
*Its [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] concept is similar to the [[Executioner|Executioner's]] own [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters.]]\
*The '''Prometheus''' was the most expensive non-event build menu ship in the game, before Super Capital ships were released on the build menu. The ship costed 709,023 credits worth of materials and building fee to make. Counting the cost of the [[Warehouse]] upgrades needed to make the ship, the total cost was 2,487,273 credits, which was 24% more than a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] ship while they were quest ships.\
*While the '''Prometheus''' possesses a bridge protruding from the hull near the rear of the ship and offset to the right, the actual bridge is inside the main body between the quad thruster sections and behind the hangar bay.\
*The '''Prometheus''' possesses a teleporter in the bridge that will take the player to the exterior of the ship between the two rear dorsal thrusters. This teleporter seemingly has no use at the moment and may have been left over from when the ship was being designed and hints that the ship originally docked from the rear, or was left over from a proposed [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]] [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]], similar to the [[Elanis]].\
*The '''Prometheus''' is based off the Javelin class destroyer from Star Citizen.\
*The '''Prometheus''' was the only ship buildable with ores to exceed the storage of a level 32 [[Warehouse]], at the time it exceeded that number, the maximum warehouse level was 32 but has since been raised to 35 (and then 38).\
*The '''Prometheus''' was considered by some to be Galaxy's first supercarrier or supercapital carrier.\
*This ship is a rather common sight nowadays.\

==Description  ==\
The '''Galaxy '''is the 2nd largest, 3rd fastest harvesting (43 m<sup>3</sup>/s) and one of two [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] Class ships within the game (The other being a limited counterpart, the Freedom Galaxy) with 2 [[Turrets|Large Mining Lasers]] and 2 Large Advanced Mining Lasers. It takes a minimum of about 2 minutes & 46 seconds to fill up its Ore Hold.\
== Appearance  ==\
The interior of the Galaxy can be accessed via teleporter on the docking ramp. This will take players to a small room with three chairs. The center pilot's seat faces three screens. To the left of the door that teleports players back outside the ship is a polygonal wolf/bear graphic.\
== Advantages  ==\
* Has the 3rd highest mining rate with its 2 Large Mining Lasers and 2 Large Advanced Mining Lasers.\
* Has the 2nd largest Ore Hold in the game, with an [[Ores]] Capacity of 8,000.\
* Has an explosion value of 300.\
*2 Hours and 30 Minutes for normal mining, if you get a steady exact 6 minutes, however we cannot grant a REAL estimation because of the mechanics of loyalty. I estimated this to be EXACTLY 10k each round, so get this with a grain of salt. \
*With shutdown mining, it takes approximately 10 runs for 210k, if it's with a steady 7~8 minutes, it would be 1hr 10 mins ~ 1hr 20 mins. Again, this is just in estimation, if you consistently mine for exactly this amount of minutes, so I'll make it as a disclaimer.\
== Disadvantages  ==\
* All Turrets are top-mounted, requiring the ship to be below or in front (at an angle) of Ores and Materials.\
* The most expensive build menu Miner, and a prime target for [[Pirating|Pirates]].\
* Huge, bulky, and slow, making it an easy target.\
* [[Aliens]] often attack Miners like the '''Galaxy'''.\
* Extremely expensive Uranium cost, a rare and expensive ore.\
* Extremely expensive if you do not have the [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP Gamepass]], as the non-VIP quest costs 600 thousand credits and an additional 4 data shards, 2 antimatter shards, and 1 quantum core.\
== Strategy  ==\
* Don't mine during a [[War]].\
* If you are mining in a '''Galaxy''' and you get ambushed by combat [[Ships]] or [[Aliens]], your best bet at escape would be to quickly get retreat to your [[Starbase]] (via warp) and despawn. (Do not over-estimate the health of the '''Galaxy'''. Just because it has high health doesn't mean it has damage resistance)\
* Do not use this as a nuke. While the '''Galaxy''' is an adequate nuke ship, it is very costly, instead, use the [[Orca]].\
*Do not use this as a tank, it is not worth it.\
* Ideally, only use this on [[U.N.E]].\
* The large mining lasers have a range of 6.5k and the advanced large mining lasers have 6k range. Additionally, you can utilize the various ship angles to have all of your turret's mining, this is due to the overwhelming length of the Galaxy.\
* Beware of warp traps and dock blocks.\
==Version History==\
* Disabled along with all other Advanced Ships (previously identified as Artifact Ships) in version .65a due to people cheating to get [[Artifacts]].\
* Re-enabled in version .65b, but cost increased dramatically from 795,900 Credits to 2.5 million Credits.\
* Remodeled in version .66b\
* Remodeled in version .66k.\
* Permanently taken off sale in version .70b.\
* Shields and Hull reduced from 10,000/10,000 to 7,500/7,500 in version .71c.\
* 2 Large Mining Lasers replaced with 2 Large Advanced Mining Lasers, ore hold decreased from 10000 to 9000, cargo hold decreased from 800 to 750 in version .72e1.\
* Ore hold slightly nerfed from 9000 to 8500 in version .72e4\
* Ore Hold nerfed from 8500 to 8000, Explosion Value nerfed from 600 to 300, and released on the build menu in version .73b1 and now requires VIP.\
* Non-VIP Quest added in version .75a5.\
* Non-VIP Quest removed in version .75a5, due to RC restrictions.\
*Shields and Hull reduced again from 7,500/7,500 to 6,000/5,000 in version .75a10.\
*Non-VIP quest reintroduced in version .75b14.\
== Trivia  ==\
* The '''Galaxy''' was previously the only non-Super Capital Advanced Ship that was constantly available; all others were part of a quest that changes monthly.\
* Alongside the [[Festive Wasp]], [[Freedom Galaxy]], and the [[Patriotic Rorqual]] (if you count the Patriotic Mining Lasers), the '''Galaxy''' is the fourth of its class to have Large Mining Lasers.\
* Used to be the eighth most expensive ship in the game. \
* jay4444444444, the same person to be the first to lose a [[Cyber Leviathan]], was also the first person to lose a '''Galaxy''' (to an Alien).\
* Used to be the only Miner that must be bought from a ship quest requestor.\
* Based off the design of the Leviathan from Fractured Space.\
* Used to Cost 27,500 ROBUX to buy enough Credits.\
* It would take you 50 runs to afford the material of the '''Galaxy''' with an Orca, assuming that you can dump for 8,500 Credits.\
* Only gives $538,097 Credits if you sell it.\
* You can make more than 10,000 Credits per run with this ship, even with low [[Loyalty]], and can make more than 12,000 Credits per run at 30% Loyalty.\
* If you have 20% Loyalty or more, you can start transfer dumping to make way more Credits than normal. With 30% Loyalty you make around 20-24K Credits.\
* You obtain 61 [[Score]] per dump in this vessel.\
*Shortly before the remodel that gave the Galaxy its current model, the main part of the hull was removed by Confinium in a fit of rage after having been caught selling ships to players for Robux. This made it so that players had to teleport to the ship's controls due to 90% of the ship being gone.\
* The '''Galaxy''' was the most expensive miner ever until Freedom Galaxy came out, and even then, it remains the most expensive non-event miner.\
*For a while, the '''Galaxy''' was made unobtainable as of .70a due to the mining/economy rebalance update. Any miner above the 6.5k ore hold limit including '''Galaxy''' and Freedom Galaxy were unobtainable and '''lost forever''' if destroyed, even if you submitted a refund request because of dockblocking, glitches, etc. During this time, most galaxies brave enough to mine in public servers were subsequently dock blocked.\
**As of Feb. 18th, 2021, players may [[User blog:Explodabat/Galaxy Exchanges Reference|trade their '''Galaxy''' or Freedom Galaxy]] for other ships with a total value less than or equal to 90% of the :shipcost price of the '''Galaxy.''' This can be done in the [https://discord.com/invite/FCGGXvk Galaxy Discord] in the [https://discord.com/channels/204965774618656769/812043152562192384/812049361395253368 #galaxy-exchanges channel](NOTE: The Galaxy Exchange channel is probably obsolete due to the Galaxy being available again).\

}}The '''''M Class''''' is a very specialized '''[[:Category:Miner|Miner]]''' and physically one of the largest ships in Galaxy.\
== Description ==\
The '''M Class''' is a very large [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] that was added in .60d. It comes equipped with 2 of its unique [[Turrets|M Class Mining Lasers]], 6000 Ore Hold, and 400 Cargo Hold. It has a high amount of [[Hull]] but a low amount of [[Shields]], making it vulnerable to [[Pirating|Pirates]]. It also moves quite slowly when not in [[Warp Drive|Warp.]] It takes a minimum of 157 seconds to fill up its hold. It is very easy to obtain the [[Orca]] with this miner.\
== Appearance ==\
To enter the '''M Class''', you must walk across the glowing path to the \"door\" teleporter. Upon walking on the teleporter, you will enter a large, mostly empty, room. There are lots of windows in front and around the seat in the middle, as well as a hologram, stating: \"All systems Online\". If you jump through the \"door\" right next to the teleporter, you will enter a secret room.\
== Advantages ==\
* Great way of making money. It can make lots of credits if used in sync with the [[E Class]].\
* Decent [[Hull]].\
* Great turn speed for its size.\
* Large Cargo Hold for a [[:Category:Miner|Miner]].\
* Decently high explosion value for its cost at 160 (or 1.6k explosion radius; and 6.4k explosion damage at the epicenter).\
* Relatively decent top speed for a ship of its size.\
* Most [[Aliens]] deal mostly [[Shields|Shield]] damage, which is useful considering this ship has terrible shield health but high [[Hull]] health.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Incredibly low health compared to its size.\
* Slow top speed.\
* Huge size makes it a prime target, even from far away.\
* Quite expensive.\
* Cannot mine at a distance; the ore must be inside the \"mouth\" of the ship. In other words, it has the shortest mining range.\
* A jackpot for [[Pirating|Pirates]], especially [[ships]] with a large Cargo Hold.\
* [[Aliens]] often target [[:Category:Miner|Miners]].\
* It has a hard time docking when there are two M-Classes, they can't dock next to each other, and you have to move so your auto dock actually docks.\
* Prevents people on the same faction from attacking the enemy-captured [[Derelict Station]] or [[Freedom Base]] if inside the \"Mouth\" of the '''M Class'''.\
* Due to the size and maneuverability along with the not too ideal overall health, the '''M Class''' is very prone to being pirated and easily destroyed by even smaller ships like the [[Aeaphiel]] or a couple of [[Centurion]]s; do not take unnecessary risks by mining far away from the nearest base/planet you can dock at, where there is a considerable risk that other players may declare a surprise war on your team, leaving you with little opportunity to escape and de-spawn in time.\
== Strategy ==\
* Drive over an [[Ores]], stop, and mine away.\
* Don't mine at [[War]]. If you do, check the chat and [[Minimap]] every 15–30 seconds.\
* Always be aware of your surroundings. You will be a massive target.\
* If you're being chased, warp towards a strong [[Starbase]] owned by your faction. The [[Turrets]] on a strong base often ward off attacking [[ships]]. Failure to warp to a [[Starbase]] or the [[Mega Base]] will most likely result in destruction.\
* Try not to do things while [[Mining]]. The ship will mine a full-size [[Ores]] chunk in about 20 seconds.\
* Due to the recent [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] cost nerfs, this ship is a somewhat viable nuking ship in terms of cost-effectiveness. Don't try to nuke anything that has a sizeable amount of [[Shields|Shield]] HP, though.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a nerf in .60d that reduced this ship's [[Turrets|Mining Lasers]] by 2, Hull by 500, Cargo Hold By 50, Ore Hold by 1750, and ship cost by around $80K\
* Received a nerf in an unknown version that added transparent plates to the front and back, obstructing line-of-sight outside of the \"mining hole\" to prevent the [[Turrets|Mining Lasers]] from [[Mining]] outside of the ship.\
* Received a massive buff in .61e4 that doubled its health and added ''some ''damage resistance.\
* Received a buff in .61h1 that replaced its 4 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] with 2 [[Turrets|Large Mining Lasers]]. It was also made cheaper.\
* Explosion range decreased from 150 to 110 in .65b.\
* Remodeled in version .66b and added with 2 M Class mining lasers.\
* Remodeled in version .67c.\
* Model upscaled significantly, 2 M Class Mining Lasers changed to 4 M Class Mining Lasers, and Ore Hold increased from 4000 to 6000 in version .74b14(?).\
*Loses 2 out of its 4 M Class Mining Lasers, however it's damage output nearly doubled, going from 105 to 198 damage in version .75a10.\
== Trivia ==\
* While docked, the old '''M Class''' model blocked large ships from docking next to it, earning it the nickname \"''Dock-Blocking Device''\" or \"''DBD''\".\
* The first [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] in the game that requires ores to be mined ''inside '' the ship.\
* The '''M Class''' originally had 8 [[Turrets|Medium Mining Lasers]] in its testing phase, cost over 400K, had 12K ore hold and required twice the materials necessary to build the [[Ghoul Nyx]].\
* The '''M Class''' was originally called The Spinach.\
*The '''M Class''' is a joke to most players, often being called things like “Meme Class” and “Microwave Class”.\
\
* There are multiple cat decals all over the ship. One can be found under the entrance bridge and another hiding in the interior on the doorway.\
* At the time of its addition, the '''M Class''' was one of just 3 [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] to have [[Warp Drive|Warp]], aside from the [[Mammoth]] and [[Harvester]]. The former, however, was [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] exclusive and the latter was cheap and made little money, making it special as the only large, non-[[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP]] [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] to have [[Warp Drive|Warp]] before .61h. After .61h however, all [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] were given [[Warp Drive|Warp]], mitigating this special advantage.\
* It often earns over 6K credits per mining run with a full [[Ores]] hold.\
* The '''M Class''' was the first [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] to ever have [[Turrets|Large Mining Lasers]].\
* Was tied with the [[Patriotic Rorqual]] for fastest [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] until the [[Galaxy]] was added.\
* Used to be the most targeted [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] for [[Pirating|Pirates]] due to its size and speed until the warp update.\
* Earns 1 Million credits after ~7.2 hours of mining (excluding loyalty curve and non-productive time)\
* Players constantly debate whether the M Class or [[Rorqual]] is the better miner. In these debates, the [[Rorqual]] usually wins due to its larger ore hold, higher combined HP, the fact that it can mine three asteroids at a time, and it doesn't require the player to constantly move around. The M Class does however mine ore faster due to its large mining lasers, but as it also has 500 less ore hold, it makes less money per ore dump.\
* The M Class used to be able to fit the model of [[Myriad III]] inside of it.\
\
* One of the biggest [[ships]] in the game.\
\
*It's older model looked like a Bolt\
*The M Class stands for Miner Class, as it's the fitting name for this ship.\
*Before .68b update, it was able to \"eat\" Lvl. 1 to 4 Starbases, due to their simple and small model. It was able to nuke these bases easier, however it is able to \"eat\" Derelict Station and Freedom Base.\
*Has a secret room behind the door next to the teleporter. The [[Santa's Workshop]] also contains this secret.\

}}\
== Description ==\
The '''Astraeus''' is a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] made for [[Galaxy Slang|Diving]] ships and [[Sieging]] with its massive [[Galaxy Slang|alpha damage]]. The owner of the ship MUST bring a fleet with them, with the biggest reason being that the '''Astraeus '''being almost unable to fight other PvP ships without good tactics, especially [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyers]] and [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruisers.]]\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Astraeus ''' is one of the largest and widest ships in the game, dwarfing many [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]]. The ship has similar detailing and design like other [[Event Horizon]] ships and has its logo on each sides of the ship. It has a bridge on the back of the ship, which is extremely small compared to the overall size of the ship. Many of the turrets are one of the largest in-game like the Siege Cannons and all share similar design. \
\
The Interior features a large room with the pilot seat elevated in a platform in the middle, and numerous computers around the walls.\
== Advantages ==\
* Very high alpha damage makes it potent at destroying much less durable capital ships, such as [[:Category:Battleship|battleships]].\
* High health, especially with [[Shields]]; which allows it to outlast many other ships in PvP without needing to retreat.\
* Long range weapons allow it to outrange and snipe many targets, in addition to the Siege Cannons having a massive 8500 range.\
* Amazing ship for [[Pirating]], Capable of insta-killing many miners and freighters.\
* Okay for sieges. The turrets can snipe the base from far enough away to mitigate some of the damage as well as tank the remaining damage output at range, and is capable of destroying most sub-capital to battleship defenders in one salvo if the turrets do not miss.\
== Disadvantages ==\
*Huge blind-spots behind and under the ship.\
*Very slow turn speed.\
*Long reload speed ''(which is 20-25 seconds for every turret it has)'' and non-ideal accuracy makes it hard to hit smaller ships.\
*Low DPS compared to other [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]], It does pitiful overall damage compared to other Super Capitals, and even strong Dreadnoughts.\
*Vulnerable to shield breakers.\
*One of the worst ships to attack small ships due to the very long turret reload time and low accuracy ''(However this can be improved by warping close to targets)''\
*Can be very easily overwhelmed by smaller, faster ships that focus on shield damage, such as a swarm of [[Sabre Tooth]]s.\
*Despite the high alpha, the long reload time means ships with enough health can quickly charge their warp and escape if you have no support. The reload also makes it so if your turrets miss, the enemy has a relatively long time to attack before attempting to dodge the next volley. Skilled players can estimate when your turrets will fire and warp a short distance, or move into a blindspot if their ship is smaller.\
*While the ship is capable of sieging with an okay efficiency, it is considerably (in some cases, significantly) worse at sieging than several other more specialized [[:Category:Siege Ship|siege ships]]; such as the [[Avalon]], [[Hyperion]], [[Kraken]], [[Antares]], and [[Frostpocalypse]]. These ships, while ''(mostly)'' lower in class outperform the '''Astraeus''' at sieging because of the low damage output.\
== Strategy ==\
* Always stay at 0 Speed when you use this ship for attacking, as even with 45 Speed it can greatly affect Astraeus's accuracy.\
* Stay between 7400 and 7500 studs below the base you are attacking in order to hit all your weapons while taking minimal damage in return, as the Heavy LR Lasers and Super Lasers have 7500 range.\
* Predict where the warp path of enemies' are and stand in their warp path to volley them. Astraeus's turrets are very effective against warping ships due to their long range, accuracy, and the fact that warping ships ALWAYS have 0 Speed. This strategy can also be effective against small ships as well.\
* Almost ALWAYS travel in a fleet as this ship has terrible defenses against smaller ships and one of the worst reload times. You can still die if you get swarmed. Don't overestimate the HP.\
* Never get your Astraeus hulled, as it has low hull health, and you will be focused on significantly once you get hulled.\
* The Astraeus is great for defending against sieges, and the alpha damage can destroy sieging ships in 1-3 shots usually. However, beware of large [[:Category:Carrier|carriers]] that are capable of withstanding your punishment for long enough to significantly damage you with an AI-piloted [[:Category:Fighters|fighter]] swarm; as if they are supported by a fleet, they are capable of destroying your ship.\
* Do not fire your weapons unless you have a clear shot at the target.\
* Similar to the [[Judgement]], prioritize performing hit-and-run tactics. Prolonged ship-to-ship combat is not ideal for this ship, as it lacks the damage output needed for sustained close/mid range brawls against other strong [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], such as multiple [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], or a Super Capital with decent to high damage output; such as the [[Hyperion]], [[Theia]], or [[Oblivion]].\
*Due to its shield-based HP, flee if shield breakers are targeting you.\
*Due to the terrible maneuverability, always warp short distances to stay in a position that gives you the advantage.\
*EXTREMELY powerful for pirating. Warp to an unsuspecting miner or freighter and destroy them in one or two shots, then loot the wreck with your 1500m<sup>3</sup> cargo hold. Your shields can tank fire from Starbases long enough for you to destroy ships you are pirating.\
== Version History ==\
* Added in version .66b.\
* Heavy Railgun replaced with Super Laser in version .66c.\
* Received a remodel in version .68e \
* Description changed, Siege Cannons and Super Laser buffed. Siege Cannon count increased to 3 in version .72e1.\
* Siege Cannons and Super Lasers buffed again; Super Cannons getting an alpha buff from 1000 to 1806(as well as a range buff to 8500), and Super Lasers an alpha buff from 1000 to 1445 in version .73c10.\
* Hull health decreased from 10,000 to 8,500 in version .75a5.\
* Turret armament changed from 2 Super Lasers, 3 Siege Cannons, and 5 Heavy LR Lasers to 1 Super Laser, 3 Siege Cannons, 2 Super LR Lasers, and 4 Heavy LR Lasers in version .75a5.\
*Taken off-sale in version .75a5 to reduce super capital permit prices.\
== Trivia ==\
*Made by the shipyards of [[Event Horizon]].\
*This ship can 1 volley anything below [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] and if it has high loyalty, it can one volley some weaker [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]]; such as the [[Sentaliz]].\
*Well known for the extremely high alpha damage.\
*Most people who know the alpha damage of this ship do not account for the many flaws, such as the huge reload time, terrible mobility, and lack of defenses besides the massive shield health. However, it is extremely useful if used properly in situations such as sieges, anti-sieges, diving, and pirating.\

"The_Galaxy_Civil_War_II","\
The Galaxy Civil War II, also known as the Enigma Cache Incident, is known as the worst bug/mistake to have existed in Galaxy and the second biggest incident in Galaxy. Second only to the [[Confinium Pay-to-win Incident]].\
\
This is essentially a repeat of the [[The Galaxy Civil War|first Galaxy Civil War]] (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU READ IT FIRST).\
[[Smallketchup82|Sugondese]] (smallketchup82) did not start this, it was started a while before Sugondese announced its official start.\
\
[[Smallketchup82|Sugondese]] was the first to call the event(s) the Galaxy Civil War II, meaning it had officially started after Sugondese declared its start in the Galaxy Discord Server on May 18th, 2021 despite the original date of the incident being April 28th 2021.\
== Prologue ==\
<div class=\"cardcontainer\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\
[[PataNautic|Patanautic]], the newly appointed Shipmaster, decides to add a special artifact to the loot table of [[Punisher|Alien Punishers]] and [[Decimator|Decimators]]. This artifact was named \"Dimensional Alloy\" and sold for 500 (?) Credits at Mega Base. One would drop per Kneall Punisher wreck, and five for each Decimator, accounting for its rare spawn rate and difficulty in defeating.[[File:TGCW2_Ticket-1072.jpeg|thumb|Slimyorca greenlighting the abuse]]They were promptly \"replaced\" with Plasma Batteries, a similar artifact. However, these old Dimensional Alloys could be put in the Warehouse. The player could then travel to Frion I on a public server and interact with the unfinished \"Enigma Cache\" Quest. For each Dimensional Alloy, 500,000 credits were given to the player.\
Sometime before the incident began, a ticket in the Official Galaxy Discord was opened by a player, inquiring about if it was okay to use the obtained Dimensional Alloys to complete the quest. A Galaxy Admin (SlimyOrca) replied with what was essentially permission to do the quest, as seen in the image below:\
\
Afterwards, more players presumably completed the quest under the assumption that it wasn't punishable to do so; as a Galaxy Admin gave permission in response to the inquiry.\
\
The incident went public on April 28th, 2021. However, the fire truly started about a day or two before, within the staff chats. Purpeldazee (whom will be referred to as purple for simplicity) pinged the Galaxy Admins on a matter about an exploiter who wanted their items. She asked if everyone agreed. Two admins, Logan_Bowers (Loggue) and SuperChip15 (Chip) disagreed with the matter. They were threatened with demotion. This started the staff team's discontent towards purple's habits and ways, especially Loggue.\
\
On April 28th, 2021, four Admins, asd1232468 (asd), SuperChip15 (chip, otherwise known as ChipsOmen), Logan_Bowsers (loggue), and CaptainLosticJR (CaptainLostic) were demoted for the abuse of the formerly-mentioned Enigma Cache quest. An old shipmaster or dev had left the quest lying there after he was demoted. The current Dev, PataNautic (Pata) unknowingly added the material needed to complete the repeatable quest. The rewards yielded 500K credits, and the materials were far too easy to obtain.\
\
Players and Galaxy Staff alike used the Enigma Cache quest to gain massive profits. The administrators who \"abused\" the quest were demoted and blacklisted from ever obtaining a staff position again.\
</div>\
== Beginning ==\
<div class=\"cardcontainer\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\
After the demotion of the admins, a riot started on the Galaxy Discord server. People were furious about the demotion of the admins. Purple responded by right-click-banning everyone who insulted, questioned, or even said anything regarding purple's role as Head of Staff. At the same time as the bans, she put a 6-hour slowmode on every channel, but the riot still continued. Purple then decided to lock down every channel and only keep general open. After about 5 hours, the general slowmode was reduced to 2 hours, slowly signalling the opening up of the discord server.\
\
Simultaneously, discord rules were changed to allow staff the power to permanently ban anyone for anything.\
\
Afterwards, screenshots appeared of purple talking to confinium about destroying galaxy, which made people even more furious.\
</div>\
== Climax ==\
<div class=\"cardcontainer\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\
Riots and slowmodes became a daily occurrence. About 2 days later, a now-former moderator, Vsauce, revolted against purple by deleting almost everything in the main Galaxy discord, causing a lot of people to flock to the Galaxy Wiki discord, asking what had just happened. Eventually, they did restore the main Galaxy discord and a semblance of peace emerged. \
\
After 6(?) days, things started to settle down.\
Then, purple decided to ban Sugondese and demote [https://www.roblox.com/users/342108306/profile teentitansgohomee] from admin to modeler, again upsetting the community, as Teen was one of the most well-liked admins. When people questioned purple about her demotion of Teen, she simply replied he was “Too busy IRL”, almost the exact same thing she said when she also removed Sean for no reason. She initiated another lockdown, activating a 6-hour slowmode on most channels, and she also went on another ban spree, right-clicking people left and right.\
\
After that, another brief period of peace occurred. This was interrupted by a now also former admin, Nekowok (xUnex), who took a similar approach to Vsauce by banning most of the staff team except [https://www.roblox.com/users/380593774/profile Rocket] and Purple. Rocket came in and asked what happened and Neko simply answered that they ‘resigned.’ Neko then asked Rocket to have his roles removed and at some point later was presumably banned by either Rocket or Purple. The staff that were banned were brought back and had their roles restored, including Teen's role as admin.\
\
Another notable event was the \"Sugon Revolution,\" where almost everyone changed their names and profile picture to match that of Sugondese, including Rcouret.\
----\
About another 2(?) days later, a highly controversial rule was added saying that insults were now ban-worthy and a small riot occurred, but nothing bad really happened. Later, SmokeyJoe and Lightflase were promoted to admin, causing another small riot to happen, as SmokeyJoe was not a well-loved moderator. Sugondese responded by taking the Galaxy Bot down as an act of spite and left the server, although he later came back.\
----\
After yet another period of peace and silence, DylanTheVillan101, a now former moderator, was demoted and banned for taking something that Jeffenator said and edited it to make it sound like he's a pedo. This led to another riot and a 30-minute slowmode that lasted a well over average SIX hours.\
\
During this riot, people got very angry about the fact that Dylan was demoted and banned, people started to insult the staff and the Galaxy Community agreed that they lost the \"Last good moderator\". This was said because Dylan was not as disliked as Smokeyjoe38 and Jeffenator, as the both of them often gave very unreasonable moderations.\
\
While Dylan was banned and the riot was ongoing, Sugondese, a well known member in the Galaxy Community, started to defend Dylan. Sugon got very angry and explained why the staff team is bad, etc. Sugon eventually left the Galaxy Discord Server, vowing to never come back. Shortly after Sugondese left the server, he was (possibly) banned then got unbanned. This caused him to experience something called a \"Phantom Ban\" and had to use a VPN to rejoin the Discord Server. Where he then made a message replying to a question Smokeyjoe made. In his message, he ended it off saying that \"The Galaxy Owner and Galaxy Staff are all clowns. This Discord Server is a literal circus\" to which he was banned for Staff Harassment. When he questioned Smokeyjoe about it, Smokey said that he was told to ban Sugondese for 30 days because someone told him to. However he later confirmed that purpeldazee was the one who told him to ban Sugon for 30 days. The warning system at the time did not have a 30 day ban punishment listed in it so the punishment which was given to sugon was actually an act of admin abuse preformed by purple.\

[[File:Sugondese ban.png|frameless]]\
</div>\
== End ==\
<div class=\"cardcontainer\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\
Then, on the 11th of October, Purple randomly banned 13 people, including 3 newly chosen Trial Moderators. Infern, one of the banned people who was a notorious exploiter, hijacked an admin script and illegally spawned Rift Guardians in every server, causing much chaos. Soon after, Rcouret arrived. After people told him that Purple was randomly banning people, Rcouret finally decided to revoke her perms to ban and demoted her from Head of Staff.\

==Description==\
'''Pyramus''' is a huge planet with features that resembles the old planet [[Earth]] in terms of the atmospheric conditions; In theory Pyramus has breathable air, weather and clouds above its surface with living trees, vegetation and combustible vehicles on the ground. Due to its density, the planet is majorly hull-based with a starting value (Level 1) of 47,000 total hp, Pyramus also has heavy defense systems below (Level 3) and to its sides (Level 4) but no functional weaponry on the upper surface making a large blindspot that enemies can exploit. Pyramus takes the shape of a floating island with large rock/stone borders covering its internal structures and objects, almost resembling the idea of the fictional Asgard in the movie Thor.\
Noticeably, this planet has a colony and formidable garrison from the [[United Nations of Earth]] (U.N.E Federation) armed with multiple military vehicles, troops, starbase defences and an international terminal for [[trading|trade]] and docking, there is also a cut-out section of the mountain in the corner which holds the headquarters of the military installation.\
\
As per game mechanics, whenever a team's [[Territory]] expands over the planet, the ownership of Pyramus will be transferred to that team. When sieging Pyramus, the final hit will take the base in the same manner as Frion I, Myriad III and other planets.\
\
There has been no further use of Pyramus than the placehold of quests related to trading and exchange of goods for credits, regardless of this, certain updated such as the crash of a pirate galleon into Pyramus has peaked some interests into the planet. Nevertheless, the planet is the largest that has existed in Galaxy and the planet is sure to serve to some future use and [[:Category:Galaxy Lore|lore]].\
==Interior==\
The interior of '''Pyramus''' contains multiple objects and buildings, significantly those located within the U.N.E federation base; This base holds multiple military vehicles, aircrafts and defences which are on stand-by to counter most enemy attacks, the base also has barracks and different command posts to provide communication to its outer colonies and bases and maintain logistics to the troops. In the east-area, there are aircraft hangars and a control-tower with a long wall susceptible to any outside wildlife threats. On the mountain just above the aircraft hangars lies a hub for travelers to reside in from exterior atmospheric residues.\
In the mountain at the center of this United Nations of Earth base lies a military headquarters point where supposedly higher-ranking officials and traders gather to plan and trade intergalactically. [[File:Pyramus headquarters.png|thumb|620x620px|Central Trading Hub and Military Command Loc.|left]]\
[[File:Pyramus truck.png|thumb|521x521px|Pyramus Military Truck (Unknown Model)|none]]\
\
\
\
\
There also exists '''wreckages''' that were added by developers for unknown reasons, these wreckages include one [[Galleon|Pirate Galleon]] and one ancient [[Punisher|Alien Punisher]], these wreckages are smoking wrecks with no interactable parts or entrances of any kind, plus they are unscavangeable due to their destroyed state. What brought down these once mighty ships is [[:Category:Unofficial Lore|unknown lore]].\

[[File:Pyramus alien pun wrench.png|none|thumb|485x485px|Alien Punisher Wreckage]]\
\
\
\
\
Within Pyramus itself exists some basic '''Easter-eggs,''' one is a magical nyan forest within a very thin crack in one of the planet's mountain corners, and another is a large hole in the ground that leads to a maze that is completely pointless and leads you only to the other side of the planet. \
[[File:Pyramus hole.png|left|thumb|448x448px|A triangle shade with a small entrace into the ground.]]\
[[File:Pyramus mythical trees.png|none|thumb|1025x1025px|Cave with a blooming sight of nature and creativity!]]\
==Quests==\
Pyramus has been the home to many different U.N.E and [[trading]] [[quests]], however all of them have been disabled by developers as their purpose ran dry and was no longer needed, but recently in 2021 during the economic inflation, two plasma battery quests were added to subdue the [[Farming for Materials|farming]] of [[Materials|plasma batteries]] and the draining of the [[Mega Base]] [[economy]].\
===BM Plasma Batteries, 10 - Quest #2022010102===\
At a small outpost within the U.N.E Federation compound on '''Pyramus''', there are three small buildings which the one that is to the left bears a quest that exchanges 10 Plasma Batteries for 40,000 credits. This quest is given by a shady black market dealer but is told that the deal is trustable and reliable. ''DylanTheVillain101 is the giver.''\
===BM Plasma Batteries, 50 - Quest #2022010101===\
At a small outpost within the U.N.E Federation compound on '''Pyramus''', there are three small buildings which the one that is to the bottom right bears a quest that exchanges 50 Plasma Batteries for 200,000 credits. This quest is given by a shady black market dealer but is told that the deal is trustable and reliable. ''ap_ek is the giver.''\
\
==Climate==\
Similar to the conditions on the planet [[Earth]], '''Pyramus''' does well to balance its weather conditions and atmospheric layers to sustain life, trees and vegetation has been reported to prosper by U.N.E scientists and while the planet does contain some anomalies such as strange mystical trees, the planet is habitable and will serve as a promising colony for the U.N.E federation.\
==Version History==\
* Clouds on Pyramus Fixed. They no longer register as hitboxes/interfere with movement <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\">(.74)</span>\

''Visit this [[Advanced Ship Computers|Page]] to see if this ship is in rotation as it is classified as an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship.]]''\
\
The '''''Zhen''''' is a swift and [[:Category:Advanced Ship|'''Advanced''']] '''[[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]]'''.\
\
==Description==\
The '''Zhen '''has a naturally flat design, which gives it a huge edge in dog-fighting. Its four [[Turrets]] are [[Turrets|Advanced AutoLasers and AutoCannons]], which help tremendously when it comes to fighting smaller ships.\
\
This ship excels at being an agile PvP Ship with multi-role capabilities due to it's speed, and variety of weapons.\
\
Most weapons will have more difficulty hitting the '''Zhen'''. It comes equipped with powerful [[Spinals]], carrying four [[Spinals|Small Torpedoes]] and two [[Spinals|Large Phasers]] that are capable of massive damage if you can hit the ship you are attacking.\
==Appearance==\
The '''Zhen''' has a long and extremely thin profile, with detailing and shape extremely similar to that of [[Nightmare]]. The ship mainly features a cyber-futuristic appearance; An extremely large spinal barrel spanning half of the ship, 4 Long-angled engines on the back just like its little brother [[Nightmare]]. On the middle can be found the cockpit with 2 turrets beside it.\
\
The '''Cockpit''' of the Zhen is a closed cockpit with 4 screens and a control panel, just like its little brother [[Nightmare]]. \
==Advantages==\
*By far the fastest and most agile [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]], able to out-speed some [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]].\
* The flat design makes it difficult to hit, allowing it to engage ships near [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]].\
*High [[Spinals|Spinal]] damage.\
* Shreds both small and big [[ships]].\
*Great at hunting [[Aliens]] and [[Ships|Miners]], thanks to its firepower and large cargo hold.\
*Extremely effective in swarms, a swarm of even just 3-4 can output DPS rivaling the [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]], and can’t be destroyed without powerful ships with precision weapons.\
*The [[Spinals|Small Torpedoes]] have a good range of 9000 studs, allowing engagement at a long range.\
*Surprisingly versatile, being able to participate in long range sieges with the torpedoes while still effectively being able to dogfight with a variety of ships.\
* Amazing against ships without turrets.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Vulnerable to [[Galaxy Slang|shieldbreakers]], especially ones with accurate turrets, as the Zhen does not have much hull compared to its shields.\
*The most expensive [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]], coming in at a ridiculous 200,000 [[Credits]], along with items like [[Plasma Battery|Plasma Batteries]] and [[Armored Plating]].\
*Damage per second is reduced drastically if the pilot is not skilled with [[Spinals]].\
*[[Galaxy Slang|Unbalanced]] Shield and Hull Health.\
*Its status as an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]] makes it temporarily unobtainable from week to week.\
== Strategy ==\
*This ship should be used primarily for pirating large [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] since it can easily chase them down and score multiple [[Spinals|Torpedo]] hits.\
*In team fight situations, use this ship for sneaking into blind spots of bigger ships for easy damage.\
*Turn your Zhen 90 Degrees from its axis then [[Strategies#Drifting|Drift]], but with Z and C, this makes it much more harder for enemies to hit you.\
*The Zhen's flat design will typically let you dodge most of the time, but beware of small turrets.\
*Avoid ships with highly accurate turrets ''(e.g. [[Ampharos]] or [[Mjolnheimr]])'' as they will easily shred you.\
*Use the high firepower on this ship to [[Galaxy Slang|Dive]] and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.\
* Also avoid ships that are effective in shredding shields, like the [[Zeus]], as they will melt through your health quickly.\
* Use this in swarms to take down larger ships.\
*The '''Zhen''' is very good at fighting siege fleets made up of primarily [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], as its high speed will allow it to dodge almost anything that is thrown at it. However, you still need to be extremely cautious, as Dreadnoughts can quickly destroy you if their turrets hit.\
*Primarily use this for pirating defenseless ships. Camp [[Mega Base]] and easily destroy underwarping or overwarping freighters, and use torpedoes on them while they are docking.\
*Beware of any explosions from ships you destroy; Your terrible health will lead to a quick destruction if you don’t pay attention.\
* Immediately retreat from heavily armed ships that exit warp very close to you, if they hit you even a few times you may be destroyed.\
* Know when to retreat, this ship is very costly for its class and isn’t worth losing.\
==Version History==\
*Price buffed soon after its release.\
*Price reduced, and weapons nerfed the day after it was released.\
* The '''Zhen'''’s 2 [[Spinals|Medium Torpedoes]] were nerfed into 2 [[Spinals|Small Torpedoes]] in an unknown version.\
*In .65a5, the '''Zhen''' had it's [[Turrets|Dual Gatlings]] changed to [[Turrets|Advanced AutoLasers]] and [[Turrets|Advanced AutoCannons]].\
*Turn Speed reduced from 0.75 to 0.7, [[Spinals|Torpedo]] firing interval increased to 0.3s, Max [[Hull]] reduced to 1200 from 1000, [[Spinals|Phaser]] barrel interval increased to 0.3 in .65b\
*Disabled along with all other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]] (previously identified as Artifact Ships) in version .65a.\
* Re-enabled in version .65b, but cost increased dramatically to 250,000 [[Credits]]. Also, it is no longer a VIP-only ship.\
*Remodeled in version .65b.\
*Buffed and recolored in version .66b—Shield/Hull increased from 950/1000 to 1150/1050, Top Speed increased from 200 to 250, and [[Spinals|Medium Phaser]] interval reduced from 0.2s to 0.01s.\
*Made available with every other advanced ship (except [[Osiris]]) for a month in version .69e.\
*Shields increased from 1150 to 1250, 1 [[Turrets|Advanced Medium AutoLaser]] and 1 [[Turrets|Advanced Medium AutoCannon]] added in version .69e.\
*Price increased to 400k in version .69e.\
*Small Torpedoes up-scaled to Medium Torpedoes in an unknown version.\
*Put back on sale in an unknown version.\
* Gained 750 shield and one Medium Phaser, as well as having its phasers multi-gunned, however lost 250 hull in an unknown version.\
*Remodeled and rebalanced in version .75a23:\
*2 Medium Torpedoes changed to 4 Small Torpedo's and interval increased from 0 to 0.25.\
*Custom drift added, 80% value.\
==Trivia==\
*Used to be the only [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] with multiple [[Spinals|Torpedoes]].\
*The '''Zhen''' is based on the [https://star-conflict-heroes.fandom.com/wiki/Zhen Zhen] from Star Conflict Heroes.\
*The ship has no [[Factions|Faction]] coloring.\
*Most expensive [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] in the game.\
*On the floor of the old Zhen, there is a picture of Sans from the game Undertale.\
*The 2nd model of Zhen's trails look like [[wikipedia:Halley's Comet|Halley's Comet]]\
*Looks almost identical to the [[Nightmare]], another advanced ship; except that the secondary colors are yellow and the ship is larger.\
*Previously, when attempting to say \"Zhen\" in game chat, the word would be censored by Roblox's chat filter. This led to it being called \"Zen\" instead until the chat filter's censorship was relaxed by Roblox.\

The '''Nimitz''' is a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]]-based [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] carrying three different fighter variants; the [[Interceptor F]], the [[Foxfire]] and the [[Instigator]]. \
\
'''Nimitz''' has a large range of accurate [[Turrets]] for hunting down small ships or while standing ground to cover a retreat or allow time for [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] pilots to arrive.\
==Appearance==\
\
The Nimitz is a long carrier that has a strong resemblance to the ship its based on; [[wikipedia:USS Nimitz|The Nimitz]] but with a futuristic steampunk like ship design added to it like the addition of ship Thrusters on the front and back of the ship, additional fins jutting out of the ship, along with an unusual carrier runway. There is a text that says '''''\"''Death To UNE''\"''''' written on a part of the ship, similar to the one found on [[Naglfar]].\
\
The Nimitz has one of the largest interiors in the game, spanning 3 floors, with numerous hallways connecting each one, which can make the player easily lost. The top floor features 3 Rooms. First is the Bridge, which features the pilot seat, along with a holographic globe behind the seat. On the side of the bridge is a holographic table with multiple shapes on it. The second room is an empty room with a table in the middle, The third room is a living quarters full of beds. Two floors down, is where the cargo bay and the hangar can be found, which span the entire underside of the ship. The cargo bay is the largest room in the ship, with multiple containers around the area, and doors that access the Hangars of the fighters found on the side of the Nimitz.\
\
'''Fighter Deck'''\
\
The Fighter deck spans almost the entirety of the ship deck, with multiple fighters docked on top of it, and at the side. There are also fighter decks located on the side of the ship, which can be accessed via the cargo bay.\
==Advantages==\
* Carrier itself has accurate [[Turrets]] for fending off small ships.\
*Variety of powerful [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*Large amount of powerful [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] gives it incredible damage potential.\
*Extremely high acceleration for it's class.\
*It has an explosion radius of 1250, rivaling that of [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] nukes and can '''destroy full health [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]'''.\
*Has the highest Fighter [[Galaxy Slang|DPS]] of any [[Build Menu|BM]] Carriers at a monstrous {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.fighter_spinal_dps|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Nimitz'}}.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Large blind spots near the sides and under the ship.\
*Almost defenseless without its fighters against capital ships or swarms.\
*Sacrifices firepower for [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]].\
*VERY high cost to equip all fighters with AI pilots, costing 3250 robux in total without VIP.\
*It's extremely powerful nuke will be a threat to your own fleet/team when your ship is destroyed.\
==Strategy==\
*Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust, as your low health will catch up to you if you are [[Galaxy Slang|Dived]].\
*Make sure you use the [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] against the same target.\
*The runway can be used to easily land and regroup [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] without recalling them, or for a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] to flee from a small ship.\
*Use your high accuracy [[Turrets]] to defend yourself and your [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] from smaller ships.\
*It can be used as a support [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] in sieges by carrying [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to distract enemy [[Starbase]]s, as well as providing great support from its large fighter swarm.\
*[[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] can support and protect your carrier from blind spots.\
*Pre-organize a group of players large enough to utilize most of the fighters on the Nimitz prior to spawning it, such as over a discord call or community group. A coordinated team gathered into the Nimitz fighters can create a swarm capable of demolishing virtually any opponent, even [[Ships]] like [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals.]]\
*Warp in, release all your fighters and warp out as soon as you can to your nearest or strongest Starbase.\
*If you think your ship will be destroyed, Warp your ship away as '''far as possible''' from your own fleet or starbase as the nuke has a whopping radius of 12,500 studs, and if possible, you can warp to the enemy's fleet or starbase to bring the nuke there instead.\
==Version History ==\
*Remodeled & Buffed on December 19, 2021. All fighters were removed from the game and new ones were introduced. Nimitz's hull went to 10,000 buffing the 8,000 it had before. The version this happened is to be believed .75a1.\
*Remodeled on March 24, 2018, and upscaled slightly on the 26th.\
*Rebalanced in version .61e; Health raised to 4650/5900, Top Speed reduced to 21, Acceleration reduced to 3, Turn Speed reduced to 0.03 and Cargo Hold increased to 1200.\
*Turn Speed increased from 0.03 to 0.05 in an unknown version.\
*[[Shields]] increased to 5860 in version .68b.\
*Remodeled and buffed in version .68d, Acceleration increased from 3 to 50, added one more [[Interceptor]], health increased from 5860/5900 to 10000/8000, and Turret loadout changed to 2 [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannons]], 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] and 3 [[Turrets|Heavy Point Defense Lasers]].\
*13 [[Interceptor]]s were switched out with 3 [[Instigator]]s, 3 [[Interceptor F]] and 7 [[Foxfire]]s in version .68e, which were then switched out with 11 [[Foxfire]]s, 1 V-22 Osprey-S and 1 V-22 Osprey-H in version .75a5.\
*Taken out of build menu in version .69d2 for violating lag protocol.\
* 3rd model was reverted to the 2nd model as the 3rd model caused lag issues.\
*Heavy PDL count reduced from 2 to 1 in version .75a5\
* Health pool nerfed from 9000 shield, 8000 hull to 8000 shield 3000 hull, nuke was buffed shortly afterwards in version .75a5.\
*Reverted model to HannahB548's model and complete overhaul of the ship including its fighters in version .75a36.\
==Trivia==\
*It's old model is based on the''[[wikipedia:USS Nimitz|''' Nimitz''']]''' class supercarrier,''''' from which it also gets its name.\
*It's 3rd model is based on the [https://starcitizen.fandom.com/wiki/Kraken Drake Kraken] from [[wikipedia:Star Citizen|Star Citizen]].\
*The [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] that carries the second most Fighter variants, at a count of 3, only beaten by the [[Alpha Ship]], at a count of 6.\
*One of three [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] to have [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] docked on the exterior of the [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]], the others being the [[Frostfire]]s from the [[Hailstorm]] and the [[Hunter]]s from the [[Executioner]].\
*Has the most [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] out of all other [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]].\
*In an older version of the Nimitz, some of the [[Interceptor|former Fighter]]s on the ship occasionally will bug out and will only do loop-de-loops when piloted.\
*The previous model had a Hydra symbol on one of the screens.\

The Kodiak is a [[Pirates|Pirate]] [[:Category:AI|AI]] [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] that has an extremely high firepower.\
==Appearance==\
The Kodiak is an extremely small [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] that has an identical model to the [[Kraken]], but has a Gold-Brown colour palette instead.\
\
There is a teleporter on the left side of the ship that leads to the Interior.\
\
The '''<u>Interior</u>''' is a yellow cockpit with a transparent window in-front of a wooden chair and table, the laptop's screen contains text saying \"pleb has some serious issues\".\
== Behavior==\
The '''Kodiak''' is a Pirate boss that drops materials necessary to create the ships such as the [[Obliterator]] and [[Nautilus]]. The Kodiak can spawn multiple times in a round, however, due to the wait length and average round length, often only spawns once. \
\
The Kodiak is extremely agile for a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] at 100 Top speed and 0.4 Turn Speed.\
\
The Kodiak spawns every 240 minutes on a Public server and no player count requirement. It does not spawn in Private Servers as in the latest version. As with all boss ships like the [[Decimator]] and [[Galleon]], the Kodiak can call pirate ships to its side for reinforcements. These reinforcement ships can be dangerous at close range but can straggle behind, making them less of a threat until they warp to catch up.\
\
This ship exhibits typical AI behavior, chasing after its targets by warping and moving back and forth in a roughly linear pattern when targets are stationary. Once it locks on and begins firing at its target, it won't stop until the target or itself has been destroyed.\
\
\
''A friendly warning to the community:''\
\
'''The explosion radius is 1500 or 15,000 studs, the 2nd highest in the game tied with both prototypes and the [[Lucifer]] (being behind [[Mothership]] at levels 3-5), be sure to warp far, far away from it to avoid being nuked, as anything within that radius will likely be destroyed. The safest option is warping roughly 15k from the explosion, but most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] can survive closer ranges without difficulty. Keep in mind that the damage increases greatly the closer you are to the explosion.'''\
\
Kodiak's nuke damage is '''exactly 7500''' at point-blank range to an E Class (12% damage resistance) at full shield. Warp more than 15k away from Kodiak when Kodiak is dying if you are not able to survive that amount of damage. It is also worth noting that a full health E Class is able to face tank a Kodiak nuke. So don't be afraid to vulture by tanking the explosion if you know you won't be dived afterwards.\
\
==Strategy ==\
*This ship's high firepower can destroy even well-armored tanking ships extremely quickly at close range, so a distraction ship such as the [[Draco]] or [[Viper]] is highly recommended. - One way to kill a Kodiak is to lure it to a [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] such as [[Mothership]] or a [[:Category:Planets|Planet]] such as an upgraded [[Frion I]] and fly around it 5k studs from Kodiak so the Kodiak would fire at the player but misses allowing the Planet/Starbase to kill the Kodiak with ease. \
*Warp very far away due to the very large and powerful nuke, at least 15,000 studs. You'll have time to warp, but do not delay.\
*Even most [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], and some [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]], cannot take on the full firepower of the Kodiak, even without taking its spinals. Be very aware of this, stay near the starbase/planet, and dock-despawn if you're taking large amounts of damage at once and are not confident to keep taking it.\
* Teamwork helps greatly, but it can be solo'ed if you're willing to take risks.\
*A common strategy is to lure the Kodiak to the [[Mega Base]], assuming the [[Decimator]] is present with an alien fleet (due to their similar spawn times), and let the 2 fleets destroy/cripple one another. While the Kodiak usually wins this encounter, it has been recorded that the Decimator has come very close to winning, at times surviving (although usually with player help) up to the Kodiak's explosion.\
*Stay at least 8k away and dodge incoming torpedoes if the Kodiak is targeting you. Up close it can absolutely obliterate most [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]] before they do any real damage. '''Do not warp further than 15k from it. It will warp to you and you may lose your ship.'''\
*Try to designate a ship as a target for the Kodiak so they can lure it in one direction at a distance and let other combat ships deal damage. If done properly, everyone attacking the Kodiak will take little to no damage.\
*When looting the Kodiak, make sure you’re not at war in case other players become angry, most people will want the loot and may attack if you take it without clear permission. Keep in mind that even if you are not at war people may still start a war.\
*Another way of soloing it is to use an [[AI Fighters|AI Fighter]] [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]]. <span class=\"mw-customtoggle-myDivision\"><u>Click this for more information.</u></span>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-myDivision\">For this strategy to work better, it is recommended to get a Carrier with powerful fighters such as the [[Nyx]], [[Icarus]] or [[Prometheus]] to use your AI Fighters with.\
First, warp to Kodiak with a 9k-13k stud offset from it, then release fighters. \
\
Second, after releasing the fighters, turn to your right/left and warp 7k once Kodiak reaches 7k studs from you and keep repeating this cycle, if done correctly you should receive little to no damage from Kodiak while you get the full Combat Reward.\
\
'''Note:''' You have to keep pressing attack on your AI Fighter control center to ensure that your AI Fighters do not target ships other than Kodiak.\
'''Note 2:''' It is not recommended to use this strategy the second time Kodiak spawns (480 Minutes) as [[Galleon]] spawns 10 minutes after it.</div>\
==Loot==\
The wreck of the Kodiak contains 2 Quantum Cores, 2 Kodiak Platings, 60 Plasma Batteries, 660(?) Armor Scraps, and 7500 Material Scraps, along with 250000 credits in combat rewards when destroyed solo without any support.\
\
'''Note:''' ''You can only loot up to 1 quantum core, 1 kodiak plating, 5 plasma batteries and 30 armor scrap from Kodiak at once. If you wish to loot more, transfer/sell your loot at the Mega Base then loot again. Material scrap has no loot limit and you can loot all of them in one go if you have enough cargo hold.''\
\
==Version History==\
* Disabled in an unknown version.\
*It was previously equipped with 4 Triple Heavy Cannons and 4 Triple Heavy Lasers, but in version .65a6, with the [[Kraken]].\
*Re-enabled as a naturally-spawning boss in version .73a3.\
*20 Armored Platings changed to 500 Armor Scraps in version .73c10.\
*From 7 players could was changed to 3 players to be able to spawn the Kodiak\
*3 player now only needs 1 player with 90 minutes of round\
*Requires 4 players and spawns at a point between 21 and 150 minutes. (.74b17)\
*Player requirement reduced once more to at least 1 player in an unknown version.\
* Loot Reduced in an unknown version, 30 [[Plasma Battery]] --> 15 Plasma Batteries, 750 [[Armor Scrap]] --> 375 Armor Scraps in an unknown version.\
==Trivia ==\
* A similar ship named the [[Hijacked Kodiak]] exists in the game, but its purpose is unknown.\
*The Kodiak used to be spawned at Lucifer Station by obtaining an item through the quest Dining In Hell. It had 18,000 Shield and 18,000 Hull and was equipped with 4 Kodiak Lasers and 4 Kodiak Cannons. The Kodiak also had 8 Medium Torpedoes and 4 Huge Phasers as Spinals, similarly to the current version. The Kodiak previously dropped up to 5 Kodiak Armor Plates, a material previously used to create the [[Kraken]] through the questline [[Depthbreaker]].\
*Has an admin variant, called the [[Kodiak A]], which has way less HP and smaller hitbox than the Kodiak boss\
*Referring to the turret change, the Kodiak and [[Kraken]] share turret models and sounds, most notably the railguns, although with different projectile coloring, turret coloring/texturing, and size.\
*It is possible for Kodiak (along with Galleon, X-0, Decimator and Punisher) to spawn all at once at the start of a new round if at least 240 minutes had passed until the start of end game.\
*One of the only 3 ships that has an affiliation with the alien race Slarfie, the other ships being the [[Hevnetier]] and the [[Slipstream]].\

}}\
The '''''Kraken''''' is a long range [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] with powerful [[Turrets]] and equally powerful spinals.\
\
== Description ==\
The ''Kraken'' is an extremely powerful [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] capable of dishing out enormous amounts of damage in a short time with its [[Spinals]] and [[Turrets]].\
\
This ship excels at [[Galaxy Terminology|Diving]] and destroying Ships with it's high alpha and long range, and powerful Spinals, as well as being excellent in [[Sieging]].\
== Appearance ==\
Despite its firepower, the Kraken is one of the smallest [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], its size being as large as an average Battleship. The Ship has two large prongs in the front and an extremely large hollow torpedo bay in the middle, as well as on the front. Its has an extremely small cabin located on top of the ship. Behind it are its two large engines with 2 Antennas sticking out on each engine. It is black and grey in color with various neon parts.\
\
The interior is a simple cockpit with a chair and computer with one of the thumbnails for the game on it. There is a very small box with the model creator's avatar on one of the sides.\
== Advantages ==\
* Decent mobility and turn speed of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.turn_speed|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Kraken'}}.\
* It can cause massive [[Hull]] damage and out-range [[Starbase]]s with the [[Spinals|Medium Torpedoes]]' incredible range of 10000 Studs, along with its Railguns range of 8000.\
* Very high combined health and small size for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] make it potentially harder to destroy with heavy weapons.\
* Extremely high total damage output combined with high alpha damage makes this one of the most fearsome Dreadnought-class ships in the game, having the highest overall DPS of any ship in its class as well as the highest alpha damage.\
* The turret armament, maneuverability, spinal armament, size, and health of this ship makes for an absolute monster of a dreadnought, outside of most [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]], top-tier PvP Dreadnoughts like the [[Cyber Leviathan]] or [[Aberrant]], and large swarms of small ships or fighters.\
*Balanced tank prevents vulnerability to shield or hull breakers.\
*Can still deal a relatively decent amount of damage without hitting its spinals.\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Needs good [[Spinals|Spinal]] aiming skills to prove effective.\
*No effective way of dealing with small ships like frigates, destroyers, or fighters besides warping underneath them, which may put you in danger depending on where you are.\
*Huge blind spot underneath the ship.\
*Most of its armament are incapable of hitting anything smaller than a Battlecruiser.\
* Highly targeted due to its massive cost.\
* Insanely expensive for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] having material costs as much as [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]] and additional materials like [[Charybdis OCS]], [[Kraken Armor]] and [[Advanced Systems]], all of which are expensive to make on their own.\
== Strategy ==\
*DO NOT overestimate your health, and always try to tank sustainably so you can keep destroying targets.\
* The '''Kraken''' is decently maneuverable for a Dreadnought, but do not go against opponents who are smaller and faster than you.\
* Always try to hit your spinals, they account for a large portion of your DPS.\
* The Kraken's [[Spinals|Torpedoes]] have long range, longer than most [[Starbase]] [[Turrets]], which make it a great ship for far-range sieging.\
* Warp in and easily steal kills with your 500 damage [[Spinals|Medium Torpedoes]] and custom turrets, but take care when doing so.\
* Don't try and wait to be hulled, as it might spell death for you because you will be focused on significantly once you get hulled.\
* If you dive a big target, you can hit it with your [[Spinals|Torpedoes]] easily while it is docking.\
* Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.\
* Use this ship in a coordinated group of a large fleet. This allows you to destroy most non-limited Super Capitals if they attempt to attack you alone, or defend your bases very well against [[Sieging|sieges]].\
*It is recommended bring support ships with you to defend against small ships your heavy weapons cannot defend against.\
*Learn how far ahead of your targets you need to fire your torpedoes to hit them, and adjust based on their speed. Torpedoes do a lot of damage and aiming them properly can help you destroy ships much faster.\
*Know when to warp away from a fight. The '''Kraken''' is very expensive for a dreadnought, and isn’t worth losing.\
*Use this with other ships with torpedoes such as stealth ships or the [[Avalon]] to outrange the bases you siege and quickly kill anybody trying to stop you.\
*When fighting ships smaller than you such as [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] or [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], warp underneath them and unleash your ridiculous alpha and DPS. Be sure to turn upward and hit your phasers and torpedoes if you can for more damage.\
*Extremely Powerful for pirating because of its massive firepower and Alpha damage.\
[[File:KrakenQuestCosts.png|thumb|Listed costs for each of the quest items.]]\
== Version History ==\
* Added in .65a3.\
*In .65a6, it got its own custom [[Turrets]].\
* In 65b, the requirements of obtaining it were increased from 4 Kodiak Armor Plates and 1 Kodiak Activator, to 10 Kodiak Armor Plates and 3 Kodiak Activators.\
* On an non-version update, the price got updated to 12 Kodiak Armor Plates and 1 Kodiak Activator (15 in total).\
* Torpedo count increased from 1 to 2 in .65b\
* Kodiak Plates and Activator removed in .66b, replaced with 265k total cost and a WH level of 18.\
* Recolored and previous loadout replaced with 4 [[Turrets|Capital Triple Lasers]] and 4 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] in version .66b.\
* 4 [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Capital Triple Lasers]] changed to 4 [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Lasers]] in version .69a1.\
* Removed from the build menu in version .69a1.\
* Received a remodel in version .70b2.\
* Turret placement changed in version .70c.\
* Medium Torpedo count increased from 3 to 4 in version .73d5\
* Shield health increased from 6500 to 6800 in unknown version.\
* Re-released to build menu with new additional material costs of 1 Weapon Part, 20 Kodiak Platings, 40 Armored Platings, and 1 Quantum Core in version .75a1(?).\
* Removed from Build Menu again in version .75a5.\
* Kraken Laser turrets changed for Kraken Multilasers, and Shield health increased from 6,800 to 7,000 in version .75a5.\
* Kraken released to the build menu again with a new extra material cost of 1 Advanced Systems, 1 Kraken Armor, and 1 Charybdis OCS; which are all items obtained via [[:Category:Quest|Quests]], in version .75a5.\
*Explosion Size 400 ----> 800 .75a12\
== Trivia ==\
* Named after the Kraken, a gargantuan sea monster described as an octopus in folklore and fantasy, known to tear apart and sink entire ships.\
*Uses the same model as the [[Kodiak]]'s, but with a different color.\
* Used to be the smallest [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] in the game, having the same size as some large [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]], or [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]]; until the [[Mantid]] was released.\
* The model of this ship is based on the '''Kraken''' ship from Star Conflict.\
* This ship holds the record from switching between limited ship and normal ship status for a total of three times, if you include when it was first released via a quest reward.\
* The '''Kraken''' used to only be obtainable by completing the quest [[Depthbreaker]].\
* After the quest to obtain it was removed, the Kodiak Activator and Kodiak Armor were not removed from the game, leaving them to waste space in a few people's warehouses.\
* Used to have a huge Torpedo.\
*The Charybdis OCS quest can be found in a hole in the side of [[Derelict Station]], The [[Advanced Systems]] quest is found in the [[Mega Base]]’s library, and the [[Kraken Armor]] quest is given by what looks to be a [[Naga]] wreck in Mega Base.\
*Ironic to its stats and notoriety, the Kraken is often treated as a high-value target rather than a threat because of its exorbitant cost.\

The exterior features a great quantity of detailing in a similar fashion to ships such as the [[Osiris]]. In the interior, a small teleporter pad teleports you into an orange decorated hallway. Moving forward you enter a small room with an orange glowing orb with the Osiris Legion Insignia. There are 2 paths to the control room which has 3 seats and decorated walls. The pilot's seat is in the middle and has an orange screen with the Osiris Legion insignia.\
==Advantages==\
*Variety of both [[Turrets]] and [[Spinals]] give it massive damage output and range.\
*[[Turrets|Turret]] mount gives good line of sight to defend the ship from almost every angle.\
*Very strong explosion value of 1500 (The same as Prototypes, an 87.5% larger nuke than Prometheus, coming in at a radius of 15,000 studs).\
*Extremely high alpha damage with its [[Spinal Weaponry|spinals]] and turrets.\
*Can obliterate hull from its overwhelming Hull DPS and alpha.\
*Can siege bases from afar with its [[Spinal Weaponry|huge torpedoes]] since it outranges [[starbase]] turrets. Additionally, a large portion of its turrets can outrange a starbase's main heavy-hitting turrets (aside from railguns), further reducing risk.\
*Effective at destroying large and sluggish ships due to the high damage output.\
*Has a high cargo hold of {{#cargo_query:tables=ShipData|fields=ShipData.cargo_hold|where=ShipData._pageName = 'Hyperion'}} making it able to loot wrecks.\
*Ridiculous efficiency in sieges, due to the long range, massive damage, high health, and status as a Super Capital, which can scare off most enemies.\
*Only slightly worse than [[Astraeus]] in diving, while having DPS only slightly worse than Theia, and having overall great amount of health makes this a really powerful Super Capital.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Like most super capitals, this ship is vulnerable to swarming.\
*Turrets suffer from very poor accuracy against moving targets, making it easy to miss a ship even the size of a [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreadnought]] from medium range if the target is moving (this also applies inversely; if the ship is moving too fast against a stationary target, the turrets are prone to missing from a distance).\
*You have to point directly at targets to shoot all turrets and [[Spinals]].\
*The Huge Torpedoes move at a snail's pace (300 studs/second), making it rather difficult to hit moving targets unless you're within very close range of them, or they are very large.\
*Additionally, the huge torpedoes have a very long reload time.\
*Very expensive, being the 2nd most expensive super capital putting it behind the Lucifer (except for [[:Category:Prototype|prototypes]]) and requiring an SC Build Permit.\
*Somewhat sluggish maneuverability compared to some other super capital ships.\
*Has a long hallway from the pilot's seat to the exit, increasing the time for you to de-spawn. Additionally, due to issues with the interior, the player can get stuck inside the body of ship, and the teleporter may break for certain players (usually not the pilot). Both of these are refundable if sufficient evidence is provided.\
\
== Strategy==\
*Travel in fleets so you are defended from other fleets or swarms.\
*Focus on larger targets at close range when you can to ensure that your weapons can land accurately.\
*In a [[Sieging|Siege,]] you can defend from large ships that attempt to break up the fleet. You can also outrange [[Starbase]]s with the [[Spinals]], and some of the turrets.\
*Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.\
*Even though this ship has a strong nuke, it is almost certainly not worth doing a suicide mission in this ship due to the expense.\
*Pick your battles: Unless you know you have a fleet you can trust and that the enemy team has neither lots of competent and coordinated players or tricks up their sleeve, it is almost always better to use a cheaper alternative.\
==Version History ==\
*Added in version .65b\
*Disabled in .66b along with the other [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]] due to [[Materials|Weapons Part and Alien Device]] duplication.\
*Reactivated in .66b shortly after being disabled but now with a [[Credits|Credit]] cost.\

*Reworked yet again in version .74b12; Shields increased from 12000 to 13000, Top Speed reduced from 65 to 55, Acceleration reduced from 25 to 20, Turn Speed increased from 0.11 to 0.13, Loadout changed to 2 Hyperion Triple Heavy Lasers, 2 Heavy Quantum Lasers and 4 Hyperion Dual Heavy Railguns; Spinal Loadout changed from 9 Huge Torpedoes to 4 Huge Phasers and 4 Huge Torpedoes, lost 2 HyperionShield fighters, explosion radius increased from 1250 to 1270 (explosion radius buff only revealed in-game).\
*Shield increased from 13,000 to 13,100 in an unknown version.\
*Received Hyperion Lasers in an unknown version. (Only revealed in-game.)\
*Received an explosion value increase to 1370 in unknown version.\
*Received yet another explosion value increase to 1500 in version .75a5.\
*Taken off-sale in version .75a5 to reduce permit prices.\

*Parts of this ship's original model were teased during April Fools, with the images being described as pictures of the [[Prototype X-3]].\
*The '''Hyperion '''has its own unique [[Turrets]].\
*The first player to lose this ship was Goodbroly3. It was the first true [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] to be destroyed (excluding the Prototypes). \
*This ship has a \"sister,\" named the [[Theia]]. The Theia is a PvP based variant of the '''Hyperion''' more focused on spinal firepower.\
* The \"Huge Photon Torpedoes\" are a re-skin of the [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Torpedoes]] and look like \"Fire Cannons\" \
*This ship was previously broken and mostly invisible due to meshing issues.\
*One of the best ships in the entire game for sieges, due to the insane DPS, range, and health.\
*Its core is also used to power the [[Jackal]], according to the Jackal's description.\
*The small insignia of an eagle with a star could be a reference to Stellaris' Commonwealth of Man.\
*It also has a similar design to the [[Jackal]], [[Vanguard]], and [[Falcon]]s.\
*Has a secret room in its Christmas Reskin that has a picture of a fictional girl and many Christmas decorations.\

{{about|the ship|a satellite|Frion I}}\
'''''Lucifer''''' is a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital ship]] that is part of the [[Halloween Event 2019]].\
==Description==\
The '''Lucifer''' was the [[Halloween Event 2019]] [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] that has extremely accurate [[Turrets]] and powerful [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal weaponry]].\
\
This [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] ship excels at being an all-rounder [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]], with balanced [[Hull]] and [[Shields|Shield]] for tanking, accurate and powerful [[Turrets]] for defending against both Small and [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], and having long range weaponry for [[Sieging]].\
==Appearance==\
[[File:Lucifer-ambience.mp4|thumb|left|Ambience of the Lucifer]]\
The '''Lucifer''' is a long, massive [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] that has an extremely large profile, and has many spikes, windows and fins jutting out from it, making it resemble a spiky sea cucumber.  It has 3 extremely large Spinal barrels in it's front with particles emitting from it, just like the particle emitters on it's sides. It also has 3 extremely large engines in it's back, though these emit no trails.\
\
The Lucifer shares the same Interior as the [[Azreal]] and [[Abaddon]], with a black, foggy hallway, being the only difference is the color. At the front, there is a purple glowing orb with electricity coming out of it, and in front of it there is purple text that says\
\
<span style=\"color:#b708ff\">''\"'''''PALADIN OMEN ONLINE'''''\".''</span>\
\
''Note that it's ambiance is extremely faint and may need to max your volume in order to hear it.''\
==Advantages==\
*Huge, balanced health pool along with great damage resistance due to being a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]].\
*Turn speed is very high for a ship of its size, surpassing some [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships.]]\
*Powerful, extremely accurate and long range [[Turrets]].\
*[[Spinals]] output high damage.\
*Good cargo hold.\
*Huge [[Galaxy Slang|DPS]] of 520+.\
*Massive explosion radius of 1500, the highest in the game (along with both prototypes and [[Kodiak]]).\
*Unlike most other [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]], it can easily defend itself against small ships with the accurate weapons.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Large [[Galaxy Slang|blindspots]] behind and under the ship.\
* Struggles to fire all turrets at once, unless pointing directly or above at its target.\
*Ridiculously expensive, mainly due to the Class A [[Permits|Permit]], which in total can cost over 10 million [[credits]].\
*Loses more than half of its [[Galaxy Slang|DPS]] if you can’t hit the spinals.\
*Lucifer's [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]] have poor arcs and they can be difficult to get used to.\
*Its [[Galaxy Slang|DPS]] is more oriented around shields, causing rather low [[Hull]] damage output for its price.\
*It's extremely powerful nuke will be a threat to your own fleet/team when your ship is destroyed.\
*A large target due to being a Limited [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]], as well as its exorbitant cost.\
==Strategy==\
*It is '''never''' a good idea to use this ship alone in PvP. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust as you will always be a massive target.\
*Always be alert of your surroundings when using this ship, like constantly checking the minimap.\
*If [[Sieging]] with it, be sure to not only be a part of a fleet but also make use of the range of the [[turrets]] and [[spinals]].\
* Use its maneuverability to get into a ship's [[Galaxy Slang|blindspot]] and shred them with its insane damage output.\
*Never underestimate your health, a swarm of high power ships such as [[Nightmare]]s can exploit your blindspots and destroy you if you aren't careful.\
*If a ship is hiding in one of your blind spots, warp a short distance and use your fast turn speed then shred them when you have a line of sight.\
*One of the few weaknesses of this ship is groups. A few high power ships of any kind may overwhelm you if you have no support, so always try to fly in at least a small fleet.\
*Do not attempt to solo siege a faction with stronger players, they can easily spawn their powerful ships to destroy you, similar to a [[Strategies#Ghost team (Logoff trapping)|Log-off Trap.]]\
*To repeat. Be extremely cautious and watch for any possibility of danger, the Lucifer is very powerful but extremely expensive to lose.\
*If you are being sieged, even spawning this can scare off most inexperienced attackers, and the rest may leave due to the loss of support and extremely high power of this ship, but this is risky as you may be targeted immediately.\
* If you think your ship will be destroyed, Warp your ship away as '''far as possible''' from your own fleet or [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] as the nuke has a whopping radius of 15000 studs, and if possible, you can warp to the enemies' fleet and get close to more expensive enemy ships or [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]] to bring the nuke there instead.\
*It is highly recommended to record this ship every time you use it in case you lose it for unfair reasons due to the price.\
==Version History==\
* Added in the [[Halloween Event 2019]] in version .66b.\
*DPS reduced by 5% in version .66b.\
*Health increased from 12500/12500 to 14500/14500 / Speed increased from 50 (default speed) to 60 / Turnspeed increased from 0.1 to 0.13 / Spinals increased from 5/5 Huge Phasers/Cannons to 7/7 Huge Phasers/Cannons / Turrets have been changed to point defense/flak (two of each type) in version .72f\
*Was re-released some time in 2021, costing around 1.5 million and a B permit (5-5.5 million in total). Now it requires an A permit and is over double that price. Version unknown.\
*Explosion radius increased to 1500 in an unknown version ''(only revealed in-game)''.\
*Cost nerfed from Class A to Class B in version .75a12.\
* Collision boxes arranged so the user cant get stuck in interior in an unknown version.\
*Cost reverted from Class B to Class A in version .75a23.\
== Trivia==\
*'''Lucifer''' is the first, and currently the only [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] to be part of an [[Halloween Event 2019|event]].\
* Excluding [[Permits]] like the Class A Permit, the Lucifer is the most expensive ship in Material costs, totalling at 4.5 Million, beating both [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]]. Though [[Waspinator]] dethrones it at being the most expensive ship if you were to pay 7 Million creidts at the Waspinator's quest [[The council|The Council]].\
*Used to be made with the Lucifer Core, which was obtained in the quest [[Lucifer Core|Spooky]].\
*The first person to lose one was xps_15 to LegitWesternSpy's [[Prototype X-2]].\
*The Lucifer, along with some other [[Halloween Event 2019|Halloween 2019]] ships, is part of a select few ships in the game that have ambient sounds.\
*The Lucifer was originally meant to serve as the boss ship for the [[Halloween Event 2019|Halloween 2019]]; furthermore, a player-owned variant of the ship was planned to be obtainable under the name of 'Omen', hence the outdaded text in the interior.\
* This ship shares its name with ''Lucifer Station'', a small space station orbiting [[Frion I]].\
*xps_15 and Crosh105 have the lost this ship the most times, having lost it 3 times each.\
**In addition, the second time xps lost it, it was refunded as he was dock blocked.\
*If you are using a '''Lucifer''' and you jump out of the seat it while facing upwards, you may end up inside the ship. This caused a user to lose a '''Lucifer''', as seen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fuqrh4fCjM here]. The user has since got it refunded. ''This is refundable still in regards to the public announcement on discord below. ''\
**[TNCOC] Confinium Today at 1:47 PM {@everyone If you got stuck in the ceiling of the Lucifer and have a recording of it leading to your ships destruction, it is 100% '''''refundable''''' and you should submit it to #refund_request. Do not rely on the Wiki to tell you what is or isn't refundable.}\
**It is also further recommended to always record when driving expensive event ships, in order to corroborate evidence if a refund is necessary. Recording can be done directly through the ROBLOX player or other external programs.\
*During the 2019 Halloween event, the Lucifer costed 2 million credits, but if you were to use the cost command in-game now, its material cost would be around 1.2 million credits.\
*Its namesake, [[wikipedia:Lucifer|Lucifer]], has significance in religion and mythology.\
*One of the best ships for either terrifying newer players or attracting pirates.\
*''Despite being one of the largest ships in the game, the playable Lucifer is extremely small compared to the Lore accurate Lucifer.''\

''Visit this [[Advanced Ship Computers|Page]] to see if this ship is in rotation as it is classified as an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship.]]''\
\
The '''''Osiris''''' is a powerful [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] [[:Category:Dreadnought|'''Dreadnought''']] with powerful Turret Firepower.\
\
==Description==\
The '''Osiris''' is a powerful [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] has focus on [[Galaxy Terminology|Broadside]]-firepower.\
\
This Ship excels at being a flagship in a fleet due to it's speed, the diversity of [[Turrets]] it has, and having high health for a [[:Category:Battleship|Dreadnought]]. It's firepower leans more on shredding [[Shields]] due to it's 6 Large Phasers on each side of it.\
\
All these combined, the Osiris can be used as a multi-role ship like other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]].\
==Appearance==\
The Osiris has an extremely long and thin profile for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]. The ship's details sport a cyber and futuristic appearance much like other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]]. It's most defining feature is it's \"Reversed Beak\" in the front which thins out towards the front end, but despite having spinal-like barrels on its beak, the Osiris has no forward-facing [[Spinals]], and instead was the first ship to employ broadside [[Spinals]] on it's side as 12 Barrels sticking out on each mid-section of the ship. The ship has 4 extremely large engines on the back that has a large nozzle. \
\
The ship also has [[Event Horizon|Event Horizon Shipyards]] logo next to many of it's Quantum Turrets, citing the Company which made this ship. \
\
The '''Interior''' is a large room with the Pilot seat in the middle surrounded by what appears to be a glass border or wall and a screen covering the whole Cockpit. On the left screen features the Osiris's starboard view and it's current status judging from the symbols. The text on-top of the starboard view says \"<span style=\"color:#aef2fe\">ARGOS COMBAT COORDINATOR</span>\" and there is [[Event Horizon|Event Horizon Ship Yards]] logo way below it. On the middle screen there appears to be the Osiris's targeting system and multiple other texts. On the right screen shows what appears to be enemies that have been detected by it.\
==Advantages==\
*Powerful and unique [[Turrets|Advanced Turrets]] and 6 Large Phasers gives it a powerful range of armaments.\
*Turrets and Spinals are both optimized for broadside combat.\
*High Combined Health of 17,100 allows it to tank heavy fire in a siege or team fight.\
*Fantastic for PvP against other [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]], and even [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]].\
*Good speed and turn speed for its size\
*Shreds shields with a Shield DPS of 432.\
*Small [[Galaxy Slang|Blindspots]].\
*Large Cargo Hold for a Dreadnought.\
*Since it is a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], it requires less loyalty than an equivalent Super Capital, and three can be spawned per faction.\
==Disadvantages==\
* Somewhat Vulnerable backside; only 1 or 2 [[Turrets]] have line-of-sight.\
* [[Galaxy Slang|Unbalanced]] Shields compared to Hull, making it vunerable against shield-breakers.\
*Fighting broadside leaves a large surface area available for spinal and turret fire, increasing the damage you may receive.\
* Inaccurate turrets incapable of hitting anything smaller than a [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]].\
*More difficult and awkward to aim the spinals due to them being broadsides.\
*Its status as an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced]] Ship and it's expense puts a big target on your head, and its semi-limited nature along with the massive cost means it will take a while to get back if lost due to the rotation.\
==Strategy==\
* '''Broadsiding''' is key for all [[Turrets]] and Spinals to hit.\
*Beware of swarms of small [[Ships]] that can overwhelm, outrun and dodge the '''Osiris'''' inaccurate weaponry.\
*When fighting other ships, use your high mobility to try and work your way into your enemy's weak points.\
*This ship is best used in a fleet, as providing cover for it can make it maximize it's potential, and lessens the chance of getting [[Galaxy Slang|dived]]. \
*Avoid swarms of small, agile ships; your turrets aren't accurate enough to hit and destroy them, on top of your size and maneuverability making easy for the swarms to stay in your blind-spots. \
*If you are up against a [[:Category:Prototype|Prototype]] or [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]], try to get under them and behind them so you can take it down without it attacking you with their main, heavy-hitting Turrets.\
*You can take on most normal [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] in a 1v1, so don't hesitate when a [[Nemesis]] or [[Apocalypse]] attacks, ''(as long as you're sure their team won't dive.)''\
\
*Use this ship to chase down crippled [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]], as it has high hull damage output. \
*Be extremely careful during war, due to this ship's cost it is a large target for groups to suddenly attack.\
*Similar to the [[Slipstream]] a group of 3 '''Osiris'''' can easily shred any dreadnoughts, and destroy most supercapitals.\
== Version History==\
*Released in version .64a\
*2 [[Turrets|Dual Medium Cannons]] replaced with 2 [[Turrets|Medium Advanced Autolasers]] in version .64f, one light [[Turrets|Advanced Autocannon]] added.\
*Remodeled and was buffed to gain broadside [[Spinals]] in version ???.\
*Increased the [[Hull]] from 6225 to 6975 in version ???\
*Disabled along with all other [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Artifact Ships]] in version .65a\
*Re-enabled in version .65b, but cost increased dramatically to 4 million [[Credits]].\
*Hull nerfed from 6975 to 5500 and shield nerfed from 9550 to 9000 in .65b\
*Disabled in .66b along with the other Super-Capitals due to weapon part/alien device duping.\
*Re-enabled in .66b with other Super-Capitals, cost increased to 7 million [[Credits]].\
*[[Shields]] and cost reduced in version .66b.\
* Received a stronger [[Turrets|Turret]] in version .66b.\
*Quest disabled early due to glitches in version .66b.\
*One Quantum Laser upgraded to Heavy Quantum Laser, Advanced Autoturrets upgraded to Heavy PDL and Flak in version ???\
* Shields '''buffed''' to 8950 and hull to 6500 in version .66b\
*Remodeled in version .67c after having meshing issues.\
*Speed and turnspeed '''buffed''' to 80 and 0.14, along with a loadout change in version .72e4.\
*(Above loadout change: One [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Quantum Laser]], Two [[Turrets|Heavy Quantum Cannons]], Four [[Turrets|Quantum Cannons]], One [[Turrets|Heavy PDL]], One [[Turrets|Quantum Laser]])\
*8 [[Spinal Weaponry|Medium Phasers]] --> 6 [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Phasers]] (both sides) in version .72f\
*Made obtainable in an unknown version, along with [[Helios]] and [[Imperator]]. (Off-sale in version .73a)\
* Gains another [[Turrets|Heavy Quantum Cannon]] in version .74b\
* Released as rotation-based advanced ship in .74b\
*Re-released as a rotation-based advanced ship, costing 1.1 million credits, 2 quantum cores, 30 plasma batteries, 12 armored plating, 6 antimatter shards, 4 data archives, and 2 ascension crystals. in .75a\
* Explosion Size 500 ----> 800 in .75a12\
==Trivia==\
*Accidentally released in the build menu on 5/18/2020. Was found by a BlackHawk member on the Galaxy Development Server. About 10-20 were built in a single private server before it was shut down. The equivalent materials used in this glitch cost about 471,302 with a Level 26 Warehouse, much cheaper compared to the 2 million credit cost while it was in rotation.\
*The first ship to have broadside [[Spinals]].\
*Considered by many as better or more versatile than a Super Capital due to the fleet you can build up with these, and the amount of firepower on the Osiris. However, some people believe a Super Capital is better due to their superior health, and sometimes superior DPS.\
*Among the faster [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]].\
*Featured in rotation during April 2020, it was found under the stairs of the [[Derelict Station]], which could be accessed through a non-collidable wall behind the emergency gun. There, you would find the [[Eduardo|Shady Soldier]] who would sell you it for 2,000,000 credits.\
*Has a faction named after it: The [[Osiris Legion]]\
*Used to have the same amount and type of broadside spinals as the [[Genesis]].\
*(Previously?) Sold in the top level of [[Freedom Base]] by the [[Strange Character(NPC)|Strange Character]].\
*The second ship in the game to have [[Artifacts]] in its materials cost.\

[[File:Sugon Staff Hate Announcement.png|thumb|Sugon's announcement addressing the hate towards staff]]\
[[File:Sugon Departure Announcement.png|thumb|Sugon's announcement regarding his departure from the community]]\
Smallketchup82 joined Galaxy somewhere in 2017, where he mostly played on [[Galaxy Arcade]]. In early 2020, sugon said that he quit arcade after he was playing and his starbase was 10k away from [[mothership]], and an opposing team decided to blow up mothership for no apparent reason. Sugon, knowing it would damage his base and be an overall stupid idea, asked them about their motive and they simply responded that they wanted to blow up mothership for the fun of it. This caused Sugon to get frustrated with the players of Galaxy Arcade, to which he moved to main Galaxy. While starting out in main Galaxy, Sugon met someone called dhoney, whom he became good friends with. Together he and dhoney progressed through Galaxy. Sugon focused on collecting [[:Category:Limited|limiteds]] and dhoney focused on getting farther into the game. Sugon, not really liking to spend a lot of time on getting ships, decided to apply for the moderator position on the Galaxy Wiki, which he had a lot of edits on. He ended up getting accepted by SeanMorabito_YT and spent a lot of his time working on the wiki. Eventually, when Galaxy Gamma was released, both sugon and dhoney quit Galaxy. Sugon, not wanting to get back into Galaxy, asked for Wiki Administrator, which he was accepted for. He then went on to create the [https://smallketchup.xyz/projects/galaxy-wiki-bot/ Galaxy Wiki Discord Bot], his biggest project at the time. Sean fell inactive and was not informed of Sugon's bot, when Sean returned he gave Sugon Wiki Bureaucrat for his efforts and went inactive again. Sugon then assumed the role of Head Staff in an effort to keep the Galaxy Wiki afloat. Sugon continued to develop the bot, edit the Galaxy Wiki, and manage the staff team. Sugon, who was already in the Galaxy Discord Server, decided he'd try to settle in with the community. He became active on the Galaxy Discord Server and the Galaxy Wiki. Eventually, Sugon was nominated for Moderator in the Galaxy Discord after Galaxy Player kyma77 told Sugon that he had a lot of potential and asked xUNE (a Galaxy Administrator at the time) to nominate Sugon for Moderator in the Galaxy Discord Server. Sugon accepted the invitation and became a Moderator alongside [[teentitansgohomee]] and [[yname]], both of which became close friends with him. He also became friends with 1_Fast, who was the Admin Director for Galaxy at that time. Sugon became an Admin right as 1_Fast resigned and [[Rocket_GotG]] got appointed as the new Admin Director. He was demoted from Admin after promoting a random galaxy community member to trial mod as a joke. He had prior helped with an NSFW Fanfiction between him and Rocket_GotG as a joke and streamed himself reading it in a Galaxy Voice Channel, which was also another reason for his demotion. After Sugon's demotion from admin, the events of the Enigma Cache Incident occurred, in which Sugon played a prominent role in. He ended up getting Developer rank near the end of the Incident. Which he got demoted from after only months of having the rank, for [[Sugondese Dev Demotion|indirectly causing the community to raid the Field of Battle discord server]] despite  actively discouraging the raid. He ended up getting his developer rank back 1-2 months later, alongside yname who was also promoted to developer. As a developer, Sugon would mainly focus on adding new functionality to the game, usually Quality of Life changes. Months after Sugon regained his dev role, on April 9th 2022, Sugon had an idea to overhaul the suggestion system present in the Galaxy Discord Server at the time. Sugon and Rocket asked the staff team if they would support the change and the majority of the team voted yes. Sugon spent a lot of time overhauling the system, and when he was finished he made an announcement informing the community about the suggestion system overhaul. A member in the Galaxy Discord Server ended up reacting to the announcement with the emojis \"🇰 🇾 🇸\". After seeing this, sugon snapped and made an announcement addressing the hate towards Galaxy Staff, especially the dev team. The announcement got a lot of reactions from the community, most of them being positive. However a few days later, the community had shown little to no improvements on their behavior. Sugon's motivation for developing for the game had already been fading away and continued to deteriorate. On April 16th, 2022, Sugon resigned from his dev role stating that he had lost all of his motivation for developing, that he was fairly inactive as a dev due to school, and that he wanted to pursue the moderator role in hopes that he can at least try to show more activity in being a moderator. Sugon ended up serving as a moderator, where he helped Rocket with bot configurations and ran his own bot tests in the Galaxy Discord Server, most notably the nicknamer2 bot. Sugon later stated that as a mod, he was usually dragged into the middle of drama which was tiring for him and caused him to neglect school, as Sugon would find himself talking on discord rather than listening to lessons. On May 7th, 2022, at 12:00 AM EST, Sugon resigned from his Moderator role and announced his departure from the community. Sugon stated that his departure was long overdue, that he needed to focus his time on school rather than the Galaxy Discord. Sugon also said that he made many memories in the community that he would never forget, and that being in the Galaxy Community had changed him as a person. Sugon's final message was sent at 12:30 AM EST, being \"might return to this server in a year or two, probably for a day. just to see whats gone on in the time i was away. but yeah, goodbye\". Sugon left the Galaxy Discord Server after sending that message\
== [[Confinium Pay-to-win Incident|Confinium P2W Incident]] ==\
Sugon stated that he was there to see the Confinium Pay-to-win Incident happen, but did not play much of a role in it. He recalls being there for the whole incident, and that the Galaxy Discord Server's #general-discussion was being flooded with messages, that it was going as fast as he'd ever seen. Going to say that the chat was much worse than the Enigma Cache Incident's chat. He recalled the community going into great despair and models being mass archived.\
== [[Enigma Cache Incident]] ==\
Sugon played a big role in the Enigma Cache Incident. On the day that the Enigma Cache was discovered by [[rcouret]] & other staff, sugon was Direct Messaged on Discord by someone who sugon claims does not want to be disclosed (will be called \"Anonymous\"). The direct message said that Anonymous had abused the quest after being shown it, and peer pressured, into exploiting the game-breaking bug. He went on to explain how the bug worked and who was exploiting it alongside him. Anonymous was constantly telling sugon that he was scared and that he didn't want to get banned, sugon told him that he would most likely be rewarded for his honesty. Anonymous requested that sugon were to report it to purpledazee and Rocket_GotG, claiming that an admin is abusing as they spoke, this admin would be known as Logan_Bowers (\"Loggue\"). Sugon sent purpledazee and Rocket a message but figured it would be difficult to act as a middleman in such a big situation, so he asked Anonymous to get onto an Alternate Account, where sugon invited him to a group chat with purpledazee and Rocket. Then, an ex-admin known as EnterpriseEnder had also confessed to sugon about abusing the quest, sugon ended up adding him to the group chat as well. From there, they all explained the incident and informed the head staff that admin abuse was occurring. Rocket was asleep until he woke up to getting pinged so much, it took Rocket a while to get on his PC but when he did, he removed Loggue's admin. Unknown to Rocket, Loggue was in a private server. When Rocket removed Loggue's admin, he forgot to also kick him. Loggue retained his admin role and continued abusing. Eventually, rcouret got online and shut down all of the servers. Loggue then went to abuse in the Discord, until purple banned him. Purple also got on and banned Loggue from Galaxy, including some other admins claiming that they were under inspection.\
\
Sugon prevented major Admin Abuse from happening and acted as a means of communication between the head staff and people who were trying to report the incident. Sugon also made sure to voice his opinions during the Enigma Cache Incident, debating with various community members including purpledazee, who had banned him multiple times for doing so.\
== Trivia ==\
* First Developer to be given in-game scripts by rcouret.\
* Sugon has a lot of moderations in the Galaxy Discord, some say he's in the top 10 most moderated users in the Galaxy Discord.\
*Sugon has made many montages depicting the Galaxy Community, especially during the [[Enigma Cache Incident]].\

"Memorable_Battles_Of_Galaxy","==\"The Battle of YES\"==\
[[File:The Battle of YES.png|thumb|353x353px]]\
\"'''The Battle of YES'''\" was not so much a battle as it was a slaughter. Lost Souls (LS) had decided to quit Galaxy and was nuking all their ships - including event ships - in public. This \"bootleg admin event\" took place on March 3, 2020, and saw the destruction of a [[Ghoul Nyx]], a [[Deity]], 3 [[Patriotic Rorqual|Patriotic Rorquals]], an [[Azreal]], and many more event ships, as well as many dreadnoughts. The amount of players warping on the lazily positioned ships created tremendous lag, causing some warp cooldowns to be ridiculously high. A fair nickname for the event is a \"Late Christmas Present from LS.\"\
\
'''Roundstats after the nuking was over:'''\
==\"Rampage of Hyperant\"==\
\"'''Rampage of Hyperant'''\" was a large nuking event that occurred on September 3, 2019. zleftr, using his massive wealth, nuked '''36 million''' [[Credits]] worth of [[Hyperion]]s and every other [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]], causing massive destruction within the server. Even a [[Ghoul Nyx]] was not spared as it and many other ships fell prey to the [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ship]] spam. In all, '''21 million''' credits worth of [[Ores|Ship Materials]] were destroyed.\
[[File:Real gamer hours.png|centre|thumb|506x506px|Wreckage of one of many ships destroyed.]]\
==\"Battle of High Seas\"==\
The \"'''Battle of High Seas'''\" was a confrontation between TFF (The Federal Flame), SC (Solar Crest), and [[Cobra Imperium|CI (Cobra Imperium)]]. SC and TFF gathered a huge swarm out of range of a CI base, ending with SC + TFF's victory. Countless ships were lost, including [[Spectre]]s and other small ships. Later on, TFF + SC were victorious due to their [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] positioned above the enemy base, pinning them down if they spawned. In the end, CI's base was destroyed.\
==\".Skill Urself Prototype Campaign\"==\
[[File:Su.png|thumb|325x325px]]\
The \"'''.Skill Urself Prototype Campaign'''\" This event was by far one of the most destructive events in Galaxy. The elite group [[.SU|.Skill Urself]] gathered up the largest amount of [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]] ever seen in Galaxy's timeline and went on a full-on war campaign for two weeks destroying every other [[:Category:Prototype|Prototype]] in sight.\
\
Many people have never fully recovered from the devastating campaign led by MasterPlural, and the campaign wasn't stopped until the [[Loyalty]] update was introduced.\
==\"Battle of Krukis\"==\
The \"'''Battle of Krukis'''\" occurred on November 19, 2018. It was a massive engagement between [[The Holy Kryuvian Empire|The Holy Kryuvian Empire (KE)]] and [[Cobra Imperium|Cobra Imperium (CI]])/[[The Cultists|The Cultists (TC)]] /[[Vanguard Coalition|Vanguard Coalition (VC)]] which resulted in the destruction of 3 [[Andromeda|Andromedas]][[:Category:Dreadnought|,]] a [[Nyx]], and countless other [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]]. No losses were reported on KE's side. It was thought that a [[Wasp]] with New Player Protection was supposedly used to distract [[Aqueous II|Aqueous]] so KE could siege, however, it was most likely an independent player, as most KE members had no knowledge of such a tactic. CI withdrew from the battle before they could lose any major capital ships. The [[Nyx|Nyx's]] explosion captured the planet, leading to KE's victory.\
==\"Battle Of NONI\"==\
[[File:2018-11-03_20_54_09-Roblox.png|thumb|225px|\"TA\" side of The \"Battle Of NONI\"]]The \"'''Battle Of NONI'''\" occurred on November 3, 2018. It led to the destruction of TubaDawg's [[Ghoul Nyx]] and the victory of TA.\
The name \"NONI\" originated from the name of the [[Starbase]] TA was using at the time of the battle.\
\
CI was responsible for the destruction of TubaDawg's [[Ghoul Nyx]].\
==\"Battle Of Midway\"==\
[[File:2018-11-03_22_48_36-Roblox.png|thumb|200x200px|A Leecher ready to strike Falloria's Prototype X-1]]\
The \"'''Battle Of Midway'''\" was a battle that led to the destruction of Falloria's [[Prototype X-1]]. This was a major victory for DNE.\
\
This battle strategy was to swarm the Prototype with [[Leecher]]s, which were \"Meta\" at the time.\
\
Irfaan1997 was the commander of the fleet.\
==\"Battle Of Intrépide\"==\
[[File:2018-11-04_01_17_35-Roblox.png|thumb|225px|The first responders of TA/Cobra Imperium]]The \"'''Battle Of Intrépide'''\" occurred on November 4, 2018, and caused commotion between TA/[[Cobra Imperium|Cobra Imperium (CI)]] and the [[Vanguard Coalition|Vanguard Coalition (VC)]]. The battle was slow-paced and was mostly argumentative. There was little ship-to-ship combat to begin with. Eventually, irfaan997 showed up to end the fight and lead his group to victory!\
This fight comprised of [[Spectre]] swarms pitted against a [[Prototype X-1]]. The [[:Category:Prototype|Prototype]] was never destroyed in the process as the damage of the [[Spectre]] wasn't enough to hull it in time.\
==\"Bombing On Frion\"==\
[[File:2018-11-04_22_08_42-Roblox.png|thumb|225x225px|TA's Prototype X-1]]The \"'''Bombing On Frion'''\" was a battle between [[Cobra Imperium|Cobra Imperium (CI)]] and [[The Holy Kryuvian Empire|The Holy Kryuvian Empire (KE)]]. KE attempted a bombing tactic by building [[Meteor]]s and intentionally sacrificing them near opposing ships or bases to cause explosion damage. This was a success but wasn't enough to stop TA from finishing off KE's final [[Starbase]]s. \
Two [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]] were used in this battle. None were destroyed. \
==Start Of The Great Toxicity War==\
[[File:2018-11-06_20_48_39-幕末古写真ジェネレーター_-写真を江戸時代〜明治時代の古写真ぽくします-.png|thumb|175x175px|Cobra Imperium in open combat with the Vanguard Coalition]]The \"'''Start Of The Great Toxicity War'''\" is a battle that triggered an official war with [[Vanguard Coalition|Vanguard Coalition (VC)]] and [[Cobra Imperium|Cobra Imperium (CI)]]. The \"cheating\" scandal was assumed to be the cause of this battle. CI barely won this battle, and some claimed that VC won because they suffered fewer ship losses. Many people thought that this would spark a serious full-on war between the two factions, but it never came.\
==\"Battle Of Orto\"==\
[[File:2018-11-07_20_39_01-幕末古写真ジェネレーター_-写真を江戸時代〜明治時代の古写真ぽくします-.png|thumb|200x200px|Cobra Imperium fleet docked at the Mega Base]]The \"'''Battle Of Orto'''\" occurred on November 7th, 2018. This battle was very destructive, as many ships were lost on both sides. The overall winner was the [[Vanguard Coalition|Vanguard Coalition (VC)]]. The reason for [[Cobra Imperium]]'s downfall during this battle is because they lacked members due to them leaving towards the end.\
==Outpost 18 Declares War (2016)==\
'''Outpost 18''' is a retired group who created the [[Dramiel]], which is now one of the only things they are remembered by. For one day, they declared war on all galaxy groups at the time and had a massive battle which destroyed many [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], and [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]]. Not many people still remember this battle.\
==\"Hit or Miss\"==\
[[File:OldCyber.jpg|thumb|218x218px|Image of the Cyber Leviathan that was lost.]]\
The Battle of \"'''Hit or Miss'''\" was a small skirmish between [[The Holy Kryuvian Empire|The Holy Kryuvian Empire (KE)]] and [[Cobra Imperium|Cobra Imperium (CI)]]. The CI Fleet Commander rounded up a ragtag fleet of [[Razor Wing]]s to combat KE. This battle lasted for two hours and resulted in Cobra Imperium losing three [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], one of which was LordZeloxy's [[Cyber Leviathan]]. A breakdown of communication in the faction's voice call caused the ship's destruction. Despite these devastating losses, CI was able to drive KE out of the server. \
\
Two [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]] from both sides were used during this battle, but none were destroyed. \
==The Great Wraith Migration==\
[[File:Migration.jpg|thumb|275x275px|A photo of the Great Wraith Migration]]\
The \"'''Great Wraith Migration'''\" was a tactic employed by Omega_BombaKinxq and LordZeloxy during a skirmish between [[The Cultists|The Cultists' (TC)]] and [[Cobra Imperium|Cobra Imperium's (CI)]] combined forces versus [[The Holy Kryuvian Empire|The Holy Kryuvian Empire (KE)]]. The two leaders spawned their respective [[Skeletal Ghostealis|Skeletal Ghostealis’]] and docked them at the TC base. They then flew 14 [[Wraith]]s over to the KE base and began a siege. KE warped past the fighters to The Cultists' base and opened fire on the [[Skeletal Ghostealis]], hulling them quickly and forcing them to be despawned, but not before the [[Wraith|Wraiths]] heavily damaged KE's base. In the battle that ensued, TC and CI's combined forces ended the game and drove KE out of the server. \
==Battle Of Kaga Noto==\
[[File:4.jpg|thumb|335x335px|CI and Atomic Legion fleet ready to dive Aqua's main Starbase]]\
The \"'''Battle Of Kaga Noto'''\" occurred on April 3, 2019. This battle was held between [[Cobra Imperium|Cobra Imperium (CI)]]/Atomic Legion (AL) and The Aqua Order (Aqua). Both forces were relatively matched but CI's eventual victory may have been due to the fact that they possessed greater numbers of event ships compared to Aqua.\
==Attack On Kryuvian Empire==\
[[File:2wdw.jpg|thumb|361x361px]]\
The \"'''Attack On Kryuvian Empire'''\" was a battle that occurred on April 3, 2019. This battle was a conflict between [[Cobra Imperium|Cobra Imperium (CI)]] and Crimson Nightmare (CN) against [[The Holy Kryuvian Empire|The Holy Kryuvian Empire (KE)]]. Supposedly KE had major capital capabilities including the user Feraligatr001's account which supported them with an [[Osiris]], but CI and CN fought back and took victory!\
\
According to many users in this battle, this fight is a start to a new chapter in the Galaxy history.\
==Harvest King Proto Nuke==\
[[File:Roblox-Galaxy-MOST DRAMATIC HALLOWEEN BOSS BATTLE EVER!!|thumb|279x279px]]\
The '''Harvest King Proto Nuke''' (unofficial name) was an event which occurred in [[Halloween Event 2018|October 2018]]. During the event, user xiaoxong lost their [[Prototype X-2]], taking out the [[Harvest King]] that attacked it, along with several [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and any other ship unlucky enough to be in the blast range. Unlike most other battles listed here, this was an incident involving a collaboration of players against a common enemy.\
\
__NOTOC__\
[[Category:Miscellaneous Event]]"
"Pirates","''This article is about the NPCs, not to be confused with [[Pirating|the Player's Behaviour.]]''\
==Description==\
Pirates are one of the only two enemy AI Factions in the game, the other being the [[Aliens]]. Any ships affiliated with the Pirate faction will attack any ships at a minimum of 15,000 studs away from them. Pirate ships will not attack [[:Category:Planets|Planets]]/[[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]] whether the faction that owns it is on the enemy or not. \
*Pirate ships show up with dark red color on the [[Minimap]].\
*Pirate ships are not affiliated with any official factions in the game and mostly use variants of Player owned ships.\
==Pirate Fleet==\
The Pirate ships that currently spawn naturally are the following: \
<div class=\"shipnav\">\
{{ShipLink|Dragoon}}\
{{ShipLink|Jormungand}}\
{{ShipLink|X-0}}\
{{ShipLink|Galleon}}\
{{ShipLink|Kodiak}}\
</div>\
The Pirate ships that currently don't spawn naturally are the following: \
<div class=\"shipnav\">\
{{ShipLink|Pirate Avenger}}\
{{ShipLink|Scowling}}\
</div>\
* Small Pirate ships spawn in groups of 3 at random locations on the map.\
*Capital pirate ships spawn alone at random locations.\
* Pirate ships that are [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]-class or larger have the ability to call all pirate currently in the map to their aid, with the exception of [[X-0]].\
*The Strategies on how to beat them can be found in their respective ship pages.\
==Ship Stats==\
Pirate Ships tend to have more hull health and focus on hull damage.\
\
Note: All Pirate ships, from [[Dragoon]], all the way to the [[Kodiak]], follow their respective damage resistance in the Ship class they're in. ''(e.g, Galleon has 50% Damage Resistance due to being a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] class Ship.)''\
\
As of this edit, the damage resistance of X-0 is bugged and it has the resistance of a Super Capital, which is 65%.\

==Freedom Base Pirates==\
<span class=\"mw-customtoggle-myDivision\"><u>'''Click here to read about this.'''</u></span>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-myDivision\">\
Originally, in Beta. Pirates only spawned at the Freedom Base when a player accepted the [[Galaxy Star Wars Event|Freedom Base Quest]] at the [[Mega Base]] when speaking to [[Luca Sky]] (formerly [[Galaxy Star Wars Event|Luke Skybawler]]). One pirate spawned per person who accepts the quest with a maximum of 9 pirates. They also used to spawn randomly at the [[Freedom Base]]. Prior to the public release, there was no max amount of pirates, leading to swarms of pirates able to take down a fleet of Dreadnoughts. Pirate Avengers chased the player for up to 10K studs and did a lot more damage than normal [[Avenger]]s do.\
\
The Pirate [[Osprey]] was removed to make it a bit easier for players to kill the Pirates. The Pirate [[Starblade]] was also later removed for being too OP with backward firing torpedoes, aimbot, and ramming. This left only the Pirate [[Avenger]] as a possible pirate ship back then.\
</div>\
==Version History==\
*Version ''???'' added a new Pirate Boss; The [[Kodiak]] spawned by during the \"Dining in Hell\" and \"Depthbreaker\" quest paths, and later spawned naturally.\
*Version ''???'' saw the Valentine's Day 2021, which spawned pirate ships; the Pirate [[Heartbreaker]], and Pirate [[Hearteater]].\
*Version .72e4 saw the [[:Category:Fourth of July 2021|Galaxy Fourth of July 2021]] event, which spawned special pirate ships like the [[Rogue Arctic Wasteland]], [[Rogue Weapon of Mass Destruction]],\
*Version .72f1 added a new Pirate Boss; The [[Galleon]].\
*Version .75a9 saw the [[April Fool's Event 2022]], which temporarily replaced [[Galleon]]'s spawns with Pirate [[Waspinator|Waspinators]].\
*Version .75a11 enabled the spawns of a recent event ship, [[Yname (ship)|yname]]. These spawned in huge numbers and could call pirates once they have a target. These spawns were later disabled.\
==Trivia==\
*Most Pirate ships are variants of their playable counterparts.\
*[[Aliens]], The [[U.N.E]] and [[Pirates]] will fight each other.\
*Admins can spawn extremely powerful Pirate Fleets in public servers, though this is met with some rules.\
*Pirates do not seem to attack admin ships.\
*The only AI Faction to use a [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] as part of their fleet.\
*Avenger, along with [[U.N.E]] [[Judgement]], are the only 2 ships that the NPC uses without an AI Variant.\
*The [[Kodiak]] was a stolen ship that was originally made by the [[Slarfie]].\
*It is possible for '''Pirates''' to capture a [[:Category:Planets|Planet]], by hiding behind or inside a planet, so while Pirates try to shoot you down, they hit the planet instead.\

The Avellians are an alien race from the same species as the [[Kneall]] and [[Slarfie]] but are  a '''Rogue''', split off from the 2 Mentioned Factions and are hostile to any Factions that isn't Avellian. They possess advanced technologies and powerful ships.\
\
Like the [[Kneall]], they are a vicious, warlike alien race that seeks to destroy every life, including the [[Kneall]], and played a major role in the [[Christmas Event 2021]], with [[Kneall]] Ships being replaced by their own ships like the [[Shadowstrike]] or [[Adversary]].\
\
=Ships=\
\
Avellians have made numerous powerful ships, listing; The [[Flea]], The [[Solstice]], The [[Shadowmane]], The [[Mantid]], and the [[Khapri]], and had a dedicated [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]], The [[Avellian Stronghold]].\
\
Avellian ships have a shadow and ghostly appearance.\

==Description ==\
The '''Judgement '''is a sturdy [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] that deals high long-range [[Turrets|Turret]] damage and has massive Shield health, making it useful for [[Shields|shield]] tanking and [[Sieging|sieges]].\
== Appearance ==\
The '''Judgement''' is white, with neon blue near it's wings. The [[U.N.E]] logo can be seen on its sides, as well as the text \"Judgement-class Dreadnought\" on both sides of the mid-bow of the ship. The entrance teleporter leads to a tall room with several displays in front of the seat, with three of them being mounted on a desk; representing a personal computer. Behind the exit teleporter (which is a small, embedded yellow square) is a door (presumably of that which represents an elevator) that leads to a much larger room that houses the ship's reactor, which pulsates a light, neon blue color. The walls of the room have black stripes running all the way across as well as U.N.E insignias; and the floor has a lightly checkered appearance.\
==Advantages==\
*Highest [[Shields|shield]] HP of any dreadnought.\
*Long range turrets can be effective for sieging [[starbase]]s while taking little damage.\
*Can tank very effectively against kinetic weaponry due to the high shield health.\
*High alpha damage is useful for scaring away players and destroying low health ships very quickly.\
*High total health for a [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] (15,500 total HP).\
*Warping under small ships can almost guarantee a kill.\
*One of the best normal dreadnoughts for destroying crippled ships due to the high alpha damage and high health.\
*Two or three of these in a group can be devastating from the sheer alpha damage alone, allowing you to easily cripple or finish off large ships.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Amazingly low [[Hull]] health makes it incredibly weak to anti-shield weaponry, putting it lower than all Dreadnoughts except the [[SR-71]].\
\
*Very sluggish.\
*Has a huge blind spot underneath the ship, which cannot be easily countered by turning due to the slow turn speed.\
*Extremely large profile when not facing head-on, allowing even very inaccurate [[turrets]] and spinals to hit with ease.\
*Mediocre DPS for a Dreadnought, being lower than multiple Battleships.\
*Inaccurate turrets can make it difficult to strike small ships outside of close range, and the turrets have a long reload time.\
*Due to most of its health being [[Shields|Shield-based]], this ship struggles to tank Starbases from below, where a Starbase's turrets have the least lines of sight but also where the Starbase's heavy laser armament is focused. This makes the '''Judgement''' worse for using as a tank in sieges than almost any other Dreadnought, most of which have high Hull health or a good balance between Hull and Shield health.\
*On paper the Judgement seems useful for sieging, and while it is able to siege, it doesn't do so very well in practice thanks to the mediocre damage output, shield-based health, and lack of defense against small ships.\
*Very vulnerable to shield breaking ships.\
*Terrible for most PVP situations due to the large blind spot, slow speeds, and lack of spinals or quickly reloading turrets. Your only chance for doing real damage is frequently warping under your enemy to take less damage.\
*Expensive compared to other Dreadnoughts.\
==Strategy==\
*This ship can tank most other [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]] without good shield breaking weapons, so make sure to know which are shield breakers before choosing to attack.\
*[[Punisher]]s stand no chance against your lasers and high health, kill all the aliens and kill the Punisher afterward. This is an easy way to gain money, considering that you also have 355 cargo hold. Be careful not to tank [[Outrider]]s while fighting Punishers.\
*Avoid heavy shield breakers, especially the [[Sagittarius]], [[Zeus]] or [[Jupiter]].\
*Use this to counter [[Sieging|Sieges]] from your own base(s) with its long-range weapons.\
*Watch out for [[Pirating|Pirates]] that may attempt to attack your ship after a siege.\
*Can be useful against the [[Decimator]] with its high [[Shields|shield]], but be careful, as being hulled while fighting the [[Decimator]] can be a death sentence. Try to stay close to the rear of the Decimator so it's forward facing weaponry cannot shoot you. Make sure to bring a ship with accurate turrets to support you, or the smaller aliens will be a problem.\
*Get under [[starbase]]s and open fire on them to slowly drain the health away, and tank incoming fire so other ships in your fleet can open fire on the starbase. Beware of the fact that starbases do a lot of shield damage.\
*Avoid tanking to [[Hull]] at all costs, as the hull health is so little that it is a death sentence if you get hulled. As a general rule of thumb, start retreating when you have 1,000-3,000 Shield HP remaining (depending on the firepower you are being targetted with) to avoid being hulled.\
*If your other teammates happen to have a '''Judgement''', always try to use it in a group of at least two or more of the same ship. This allows you to ambush enemies with a combined alpha damage that will instantaneously cripple most normal [[:Category:Battleship|battleships]], if not destroy them; as well as having enough health to get away without being destroyed.\
*If you find a slow [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser]] or a Miner like the [[Commercial Miner]], warp under them and unleash your alpha damage. Two salvos will usually be enough to destroy them, provided your turrets don't miss. Keep in mind that the reload time may give them plenty of time to escape.\
*If you're going to use this ship in PvP, be wary of other [[:Category:Capital Ship|Capital Ships]] (more specifically, Dreadnoughts) that far exceed your damage output; as they can often wither down your health faster than you can force them to retreat with your alpha damage. If you happen to be caught in such a situation, warp out of range of the ship but keep your weaponry in range at first. Once they warp to you, volley them again and warp away; continue this until you force the threat to retreat and if it is crippled, chase after it (unless there is a fleet supporting it). '''Do not''' attempt to use this strategy against multiple ships, as you cannot repeat the action of warping quick enough to keep other attacking ships out of range; which results in losing much more health than usual.\
*If you see a crippled capital ship attempting to retreat to its base, chase it down and destroy it with your heavy-hitting turret armament. Your [[Shields]] should be able to hold up against any defending ships and the [[Starbase]] for long enough for you to safely escape without being hulled. However, do not take the risk of warping into a very powerful defense fleet alone; and only do so with support.\
*Never brute force targets, always micro-warp under them repeatedly to get out of their line of sight and unleash your high alpha.\
==Version History ==\
*[[Hull]] increased from 2000 to 2500 and Turn Speed increased from 0.08 to 0.1 in .65b.\
*[[Shields|Shield]] increased from 12000 to 14500, [[Hull]] increased from 2500 to 3000, granted a third [[Turrets|Heavy Railgun]] and Turn Speed reduced from 0.1 to 0.07 in version .65b\
*Nerfed in version .66b - Shield reduced from 14500 to 12500, turn speed reduced from 0.07 to 0.04.\
*Replaced Heavy Lasers with Heavy LR in version .66b\
*Price lowered in version .66b\
* Turret loadout changed in version .72c20\
*Shield lowered from 12500 to 11000, Hull increased from 3000 to 4000, description changed and received a loadout change in version .72c30.\
*3 Heavy LR Lasers changed to 3 Super LR Lasers and 2 Heavy Railguns changed to 2 Heavy Siege Railguns in version .73c10.\
*2 Super LR Lasers changed to 2 Heavy LR Lasers in version .73c10.\
* Received a model retexture, and granted an interior in version 74b14.\
* Interior removed in unknown version.\
* Turret loadout changed from 1 Super LR Laser, 4 Heavy LR Lasers, 2 Heavy Siege Railguns, and 1 Heavy Railgun to 2 Super LR Lasers, 2 Heavy LR Lasers, 3 Heavy Railguns, and 3 Heavy Siege Railguns in version .75a5.\
* 3 Heavy Railguns changed to 2 Medium Railguns and 1 Heavy Railgun, 2 Super LR Lasers and 2 Heavy LR Lasers changed to 1 Super LR Laser and 3 Heavy LR Lasers, and model collisions adjusted to allow for better line of sight on the side mounted turrets in version .75a5.\
*Explosion Size 225 ----> 740 .75a12\
*Shield HP increased from 11,000 to 14,000, Hull HP decreased from 4,000 to 1,500, 2 Medium Railguns replaced with 2 Heavy Railguns, and one additional Heavy LR Laser added (3 Heavy LR Laser, 3 Heavy Siege Railgun, 2 Medium Railgun, 1 Super LR Laser >>> 4 Heavy LR Laser, 1 Super LR Laser, 3 Heavy Siege Railgun, 2 Heavy Railgun); as well as a revamp of the current model (interior changed, trails changed, minor exterior appearance adjustments) in version .75a20.\
==Trivia ==\
*The previous '''Judgement''' model resembled a similar looking Ammarian ship from Eve Online called the ''[[Revelation]]''.\
*The current model is similar in appearance to the [[Raven]].\
*The original model was much smaller than the current model in-game.\
*The [[Decimator]] was added over a year after the '''Judgement''' was added, despite it being mentioned on the '''Judgement's''' old build menu description.\
*The '''Judgement''' currently has numerous disadvantages for a ship. Despite this, many still use the ship for it's alpha damage and tank capabilities; similar to the [[Astraeus]].\
*Can quite easily solo a [[Punisher]] if you stay below it, but beware of the supporting fleet, if any.\

==Description==\
The '''Prototype X-2''' is a [[Kneall]] [[:Category:Prototype|Prototype]] class flagship, capable of the highest damage output of any obtainable ship in the game. It features good turning speed and a long bow that can be used for maneuvering in point-blank combat.\
\
It is the second largest of all [[Aliens|Alien]] ships (by physical size, in which the [[Annihilator]] is the only larger ship) seen in Galaxy and was formerly acquired by players for 5 million credits, an [[Alien Computer|Alien Device]], and a Weapons Part. (The '''X-2''' was originally priced at 2 million credits). Players had to first find the [[Kneall Harbor Master]] to be able to buy this ship. Currently, similar to the [[Prototype X-1]]; it is only available when it is put on sale for exorbitant cost in the Limited Build Menu, which is a rare occurrence.\
==Appearance==\
There is a detailed hallway leading to a glowing sphere (pilot's seat) and a bunch of screens, one of which is the main screen that says \"Welcome USER.\"\
\
(Please add exterior description)\
==Advantages==\
*Extremely high [[Turrets|Turret]] and [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinal]] firepower gives this ship the highest average DPS of any single player-ownable ship in the game.\
*Rather speedy and maneuverable for a ship of its size; considerably more so than the [[Prototype X-1]].\
*Most people will avoid combat with this ship, since it is able to absolutely obliterate almost any Capital Ship with ease (though it may be more difficult to destroy [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] due to the DPS of a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] swarm, or other [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]]).\
*Great against [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]], [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]], or other similarly sized [[ships]].\
*Fast firing [[Turrets]], good for stealing kills.\
*Very high health.\
*Huge cargo hold for its class.\
*Powerful [[Spinals]].\
*Has 65% Damage Resistance since it is a [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] class ship.\
*If destroyed, it has a HUGE explosion size of 15,000 studs likely wiping out all who killed it.\
*Smaller ships are of almost no worry since they would barely chip away the health of a Super Capital ship such as the Prototypes.\
*Has an ambience that's louder than the one of Prototype X-1. Its alien-like ambience adds to Prototype X-2's menacing nature.\
==Disadvantages==\
*Not as much health as the [[Prototype X-1]].\
*Not as good at [[Sieging]] as the [[Prototype X-1]], however it is still more effective than most ships due to the high health and massive DPS.\
*Once destroyed, it becomes unobtainable, until the next time a Prototype goes on rotation, which can take quite a while.\
*Large [[Turrets]] leave it vulnerable to swarms of small, fast ships like [[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]].\
**Unusually poor accuracy on most of the turrets against moving targets (even for an obtainable Kneall ship), which makes hitting even large moving targets from a distance difficult.\
*Extremely expensive and required 2 [[Alien Device]] and a [[Weapons Part]], which could take very long to grind for. More expensive than even Prototype X-1.\
*Requires good [[Spinals|Spinal]] aiming in order to be used at full power.\
*A huge target due to its limited status and the fact that its destruction will most likely bounty wipe its pilot.\
*Quite a loud ambience. Your teammates may ask you to despawn for it.\
==Strategy==\
*In a siege, gather support to fend off smaller ships.\
*Use the long front of this ship to propel yourself under enemy ships by wedging it under them and turning upward. This way you can be out of the line of sight of most turrets and still hit all of your weapons.\
* Only use the [[Turrets|Subcannon and Hypercannon]] when they have a proper line of sight.\
*Use the extremely high firepower to destroy [[:Category:Capital Ship|capital ships]] like [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]] or [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] in ridiculous speed.\
*Be very careful with this ship. Despite the immense power, it is extremely expensive, currently costing many millions of credits along with special quest items and parts from bosses, so you cannot afford to lose it.\
==Version History==\
*Received a remodel in an unknown version.\
*[[Shields]] were buffed by 2,500 in an unknown version.\
*Received a massive nerf removing 8 [[Spinals|Huge Spinals]] for both [[Spinals|Phasers]] and [[Spinals|Cannons]] in an unknown version.\
*Was temporarily put back on sale in version .65b. You needed 5 million [[Credits]], an [[Alien Computer|Alien Device]], and a [[Weapons Part]] to get it.\
**Received a massive buff along with the re-enabling of the vendor, adding [[Spinals|Huge Spinals]] and new [[Turrets]].\
*Received a trail in the first part of the \"Mega Update\".\
*The original occasional screech was added back in .66b.\
*Shield buffed from 12,500 to 16,500, Hull buffed from 10,000 to 10,500 in version .66b\
*Turrets buffed in version .66b - increased damage and reduced cooldown.\
*Shields increased from 17500 to 20000 and Hull increased from 11500 to 13000 in version .69f.\

**Kneall Cannons were given two additional barrels\
**The Kneall Multilasers were reclassed as size Huge lasers\
**The subcannon received the most changes\
***Given two additional barrels\
***Reclassed as a Huge railgun\
*Spinals changed from 5/5 to 7/7 in .72f\
*Spinals reverted to 5/5, then back to 7/7 in version .73a3\
*Turnspeed decreased from 0.12 to 0.11, acceleration increased from 8 to 10, top speed(?) increased from 29 to 45 in version .73a3\
*Turnspeed increased from 0.11 to 0.9, then to 0.1; acceleration increased from 10 to 50, then to 5 in version .73c10\
*Made available on the limited ship build menu in version .74b14\
*Major balance change in version .75a1(?):\
**Health changed from 20,000 [[Shields|Shield]] and 13,000 [[Hull]] to 18,000 Shield and 11,250 Hull, Turret Loadout Changed from 3 Kneall Multilasers, 4 Kneall Cannons, and 1 Kneall Subcannon to 5 Kneall Obliterators, 1 Kneall Subcannon, 1 Kneall Hypercannon, and 3 Kneall Exterminators; Acceleration buffed from 5 to 22, and Turn Speed buffed from 0.1 to 0.14.\
**New turrets added to the ship, being the Kneall Obliterator, Kneall Hypercannon, and Kneall Exterminator.\
*** These turrets are improved versions of the existing Kneall Cannon, Kneall Subcannon, and Kneall Multilaser turrets; which have more barrels mounted on them for increased damage output.\
*Spinals changed from 7/7 Huge Phasers/Huge Cannons to 7/9 Huge Phasers/Huge Cannons in an unknown version.\
*Removed from the limited ship build menu in version .75a5.\
*Spinals changed again from 7/9 Huge Phasers/Huge Cannons to 7/6 Huge Phasers/Huge Cannons in an unknown version.\
*Readded to the limited ship build menu in version .75a5, from 1/22/2021-1/25/2021 due to a third [[:Category:Prototype|Prototype]]-class ship dying after the '''Prototype X-2''' and [[Prototype X-1]] were taken off sale. {{Citation needed}}\
*[[Shields|Shield]] health reduced from 16,000 to 15,900, [[Hull]] health reduced from 12,250 to 12,000, Turrets changed (please list the full set of changes done to the turret weaponry), and Spinals changed to 6/6 Huge Phasers/Huge Cannons with 0.1 interval in an unknown version (please put version[s] here).\
*HP Buffed 15,900/12,000 -> 17,500/13,000 Version .75a25\
==Trivia ==\
{{Picture Infobox Mk II|title1 = Old Photos|image = }}\
*This ship has the largest explosion size in the game (along with the [[Prototype X-1]], [[Hyperion]], [[Lucifer]] and the [[Kodiak]]), at 1500 explosion radius.\
*This ship has the highest average DPS of any player ownable ship in the game, coming in at over 700 DPS.\
*There is a mostly un-used NPC version of this ship, the [[Kneall Prototype]].\
*Has custom [[Turrets]].\
*Has unique sounds for [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]].\
*Old Description: The X-2 Prototype is a warship that requires level 5 security clearance to even view the files on it. Engineered with tech from the Kneall. It's extremely experimental, use at your own peril.\
* Players used to receive an additional 500,000 credits for destroying a '''Prototype X-2'''. {{Citation needed}}\
*This ship had the same amount of [[Spinals]] as the [[Prototype X-1]] when it released. {{Citation needed}}\
*In the interior, there is a crudely drawn smiley face behind the monitors that sit in front of the pilot's seat.\
*There are two of the same messages on both sides of the back of the '''Prototype X-2''' in the Alien script.\
* In mid beta, LordZeloxy and Cronotious conducted tests involving the [[Prototype X-1]] and the '''Prototype X-2''' and which ship would come out on top in a battle. One test was purely DPS and the other was an actual battle, however these tests went to Zeloxy's head, and he later lost his ship. Since then, as of 7/31/2021 seehyadued52 and greenninja010 have done an updated battle.\

\
== Description ==\
The '''Prototype X-1''' is an incredibly sturdy, sluggish, expensive, massive, and hard-hitting flagship. It is equipped with a unique [[Turrets|turret]] armament that allows the ship to deal colossal damage but also have good point defenses.\
\
This ship was originally obtainable via quests from various places during the Beta phase of the game, however it is currently only available when the ship is put in the Limited Build Menu, which is a rare occurrence.\
== Appearance ==\
The interior of the '''Prototype X-1 '''is the exact same as the previous [[Genesis]] model, with a short but detailed hall that leads to a small room containing the pilot's seat.\
\
<span style=\"color: yellow\">'''This section is currently outdated. Please update it when it is possible to do so.'''</span>\
== Advantages ==\
* Large Cargo Hold.\
* Many players will retreat just from seeing this spawned.\
* Excellent at [[Sieging]] bases from medium range.\
* Has 36,500 combined HP plus 65% Damage resistance.\
* Large explosion radius of 15,000 studs, which may wipe out ships unfortunate enough to get caught in the blast.\
* Has high hull damage output and alpha damage with the unique Turrets and [[Spinal Weaponry|Spinals]].\
* Has [[Turrets|Bombardment Cannons]], which are flak cannons that can easily shred small or agile ships; making the '''Prototype X-1''' resistant to swarms.\
* Longer range compared to the [[Prototype X-2]].\
== Disadvantages ==\
* Mediocre [[Shields|Shield]] damage output compared to [[Hull]] damage output.\
* Extremely slow and struggles to turn.\
* Inaccurate Colossus Turrets makes fighting any ship that is considerably smaller or faster harder, on top of being unable to out-range bases.\
* One of the most expensive ships in the game, mainly due to the Class A Permit cost and the materials cost of over 17 million.\
* The Weapon Part requires 32500 Uranium and 10 Armored Plating, which '''WILL''' take up a level 31 [[warehouse]], not to mention the materials required will force you to have a level 36 warehouse. In addition to the warehouse costs, materials (regarding the most recent release) cost an estimated 2 million Credits, with class A permits costing at least 10 million Credits, and hard to come by at times.\
* Spawning one makes you a very high priority target.\
* A very large target which means Spinals can hit you easily.\
* Can be swarmed by small ships, although this is (somewhat) mitigated by the Bombardment Cannons the ship is equipped with.\
== Strategy ==\
* Use support ships when in combat.\
* '''''NEVER''''' travel alone on this ship.\
* Despite the large Cargo Hold for a combat ship, you should not use this ship for trading during [[War]], as an experienced team could still take you down.\
* It is recommended to avoid using this ship in public/populated servers if alone or unorganized, or very sparingly, as due to its rarity, expense, and status as a trophy kill. It is a ''very'' valuable target, and many will go to great lengths to destroy it.\
*To reiterate, this ship is extremely expensive, and it is an extremely rare occasion to find it on sale as it is released at the discretion of high-ranking staff and likely rcouret himself. Use it wisely, very sparingly, and trust no one.\
== Version History ==\
* Received a nerf in version .???.\
* Received a slight buff in .60h.\
* Received a nerf losing 4 huge Spinals on both Phasers and Cannons.\
* Ambient sound removed in .62d2.\
* Buffed in version .65b, with a remodel and Specialized Turrets and Spinals.\
* Colossus Guns and Bombardment Cannons received a nerf in Speed Denominator, making the deadly armament of Turrets less accurate against fast moving targets.\
* Colossus Guns received a damage buff from 1000 to 1250 in .66b\
* Added the old X-1 sound back.\
* New X-1 Sound added in a recent version.\

* Hull reduced back to 14500, 50% [[Damage Resistance]] restored in version .69a1\
* Shields increased from 20000 to 22500 and Hull increased from 14500 to 16000 in version .69f.\
* Turret lines of sight fixed, 1 Colossus Cannon replaced with 1 Colossus Laser, gained 2 Huge Cannon spinals, ship size increased, and ambient sound re-added in version .72e1(?)\
* Colossus Lasers and Cannons buffed massively: Both turrets up-sized to Huge and had their alpha damage increased to 2000, with a reload of 25 seconds; the configuration of the Colossus turrets on the '''Prototype X-1''' was changed from 4 Colossus Lasers and 1 Colossus Cannon, to 3 Colossus Cannons and 2 Colossus Lasers. The Bombardment Cannons had their turret type changed to Flak, with stats of 60 alpha damage at a reload of 1 second. The [G] spinals were also removed and the [F] spinals are now 6 [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Cannons]]; in version .73c(?).\
* Top Speed buffed from 45 to 50, and Acceleration buffed from 12 to 30 in version .73c(?).\
* Re-added as an incredibly expensive limited build menu super capital in version .73c10; rotated back off this limited menu in version .74b14, with the [[Prototype X-2]] taking its place.\
* Shield reduced from 22000 to 19500 in version .73f8\
* Taken off-sale permanently along with the [[Prototype X-2]] in version .75a5.\
* Put on-sale again along with the [[Prototype X-2]] for 3 days after a third [[:Category:Prototype|Prototype]]-class warship was destroyed after they were taken off sale in version .75a5 {{Citation needed}}.\
* Rebalanced again: Colossus turrets receive a damage nerf from 2,000 to 1,550, size downgraded to Large, and base accuracy buffed; Shield health decreased from 19,500 to 18,000, 6 Huge Cannon spinals decreased to 4 Huge Cannons, turret arrangement adjusted, and an extra Colossus Laser added(2 Colossus Lasers --> 3 Colossus Lasers) in version .75a5.\
* Model reverted to bomb_pop's model in version .75a5, due to ap_ek's model being archived.\
* Turret weaponry buffed in version .75a5:\
** Colossus Laser damage increased from 1550 to 1650, and range increased from 6500 to 7500.\
** Colossus Cannon range increased from 6500 to 7500.\
** Bombardment Cannon range increased from approximately 4000 to 5000.\
* 4 Huge Cannon spinals upgraded to 8 Huge Cannons as well as interval being halved (0.1 --> 0.05) in version .75a23\
* Colossus turret models up-scaled in version .75a23.\
* HP buffed 18,000/16,500 -> 20,000/16,500 Version .75a25\
== Trivia ==\
* The original ship model was put into the game with the old U.N.E flag decal on it. This was a mistake. You can still see this on the retro variant of this ship, the [[Retro Prototype X-1]].\
* The previous '''Prototype X-1''' model had arguably the most detailed interior of all the ships in Galaxy.\
* This ship has the largest explosion size of any ship in the game (along with the [[Prototype X-2]], [[Lucifer]] and [[Kodiak]]), at 1500 explosion radius.\
* The original '''Prototype X-1''' model looks similar to the [[Leviathan]] because its model was modified from the [[Leviathan]].\
* Many people have lost this ship to welding and betrayal. This is one ship that you should never trust when with opposing large fleets of people.\
* Had custom Torpedo models, in which were removed.\
* Appears on the Galaxy Wikia Background\
* Hacks allowed this ship to be force-built in version .69f14\
* In mid beta, LordZeloxy and Cronotious conducted tests involving the Prototype X-1 and the \"\"Prototype X-2\"\" and which ship would come out on top in a battle. One test was purely DPS and the other was an actual battle, however these tests went to Zeloxy's head, and he later lost his ship. Since then, as of 7/31/2021 seehyadued52 and greenninja010 have done an updated battle.\
*Was the most expensive ship in the game for a insanely long time, [[Theia]]'s cost when it was added was '''11 million credits''', which would be massively reduced to 2 million credits (now 1,128,520), which lead to this ship being the most expensive ship again, [[Woolly Mammoth]] would finally end this ship's reign as the most expensive ship after a very long time (mainly due to the crazy high cost of the Class A Permit being 18.5M credits), and then [[Freedom Galaxy]] would take that title, this ship would eventually take that title back, and then lose the title to the [[Prototype X-2]].\
*Highest health out of all non-NPC ships, excluding Admin Ships. However, the [[Subjugator]] has more overall HP if you consider usage of both of its auxiliary [[ShieldSide|shields]].\
*Its previous model looked very similar to the Klingon Negh'var-class warships from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.\

"AI_Fighters","AI Fighters are a premium feature of [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] that allows their Captains/Pilots to command AI-Controlled Fighters, instead of players.\
[[File:AIFighterSwarm.png|thumb|right|Swarm of AI Fighters attacking a ship.]]\
__TOC__\
==Interface and Behavior==\
As the name suggests, '''AI Fighters''' are controlled by an [[AI]], and can be commanded by the [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier's]] Captain to do various tasks via the '''Fighter Control Center'''.\
\
'''AI Fighters, when attacking, or guarding a target, follow the same behavior as all [[AI]] Ships,''' only having exceptions when in command.\
[[File:FighterControlCenter.png|right|thumb|483x63px|Fighter Control Center.]]\
Fighters that you want to command can be selected via the ▼ Button on the far left, which opens up the '''Fighter Infoboxes''', just below the Fighter Control Center, or if you want to select all Fighters at once, just click the '''All''' button beside it.\
[[File:FighterInfobox.png|right|thumb|481x53px|Fighter Infobox Section of a [[Skeletal Ghostealis|Carrier]].]]\
On the far right of the Fighter Control Center you can see the amount of AI Fighters you bought and the amount of it remaining (''In-depth explanation can be found at the \"Dead\" Section below'')\
\
The '''Fighter Infobox Section''' tells you what fighters you have selected, commanded and the statuses of these Fighters. \
\
Fighters with a White Outline on their box tell that they are inside your [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]], on standby. While Fighters with a Blue Outline tell that they are currently being controlled by an AI Fighter and are released outside your [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]]. \
\
If you want to deselect control of a Fighter, click the Fighter with a Thick Outline to deselect it, or click ''Idle'' on the far left to deselect all Fighters.\
\
'''''Note:''''' Clicking Idle does not cancel whatever command they are following.\
\

|'''Attack'''\
|If a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] is attacking a target you selected, it's Fighter Infobox will have an icon of 2 swords beside the name of the Fighter.\
\
AI Fighters will assume normal [[AI]] attacking behavior pattern, and will try to fly to its target no matter how far away.\

|'''Guard'''\
|\
If a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] is guarding a [[:Category:Ships|Ship]], [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]], or [[:Category:Planets|Planet]], it's Fighter Infobox will have a shield icon beside the name of the Fighter.\
\
AI Fighters that are commanded to guard will fly to the designated guard point, no matter how far away, and will stay there for an indefinite amount of time. Guarding AI Fighters have a detection/aggro radius of 13k studs, same as [[AI]] Ships, '''BUT''' you have to be actively hostile ''(e.g Recently shot at an enemy)'' in order for the guarding fighters to attack you if you're in an enemy faction.\
|[[File:FighterGuard.png|left|]]\
|-\
|'''Recall'''\
|If a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] is recalling, it's Fighter Infobox will have a curved line beside the name of the Fighter.\
\
Commanding Recall on fighters will immediately cancel whatever command they are following and will immediately move back to your Carrier, no matter how far away.\
\
Unlike recalling Player controlled Fighters, AI Fighters have to fly back your carrier in order teleport back to their spawn position\
\
This makes recalling '''AI Fighters''' extremely slow by comparison to player-controlled fighters, and is a major downside to the usage of '''AI Fighters'''.\

|'''Dead'''\
|If a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] is dead, it will grey out the Fighter Infobox of that Fighter.\
\
If any '''AI Fighter''' dies ''(e.g 4 out 12 of AI Fighters die, you will be left with 8 usable AI Pilots),'' you have to respawn the carrier to regain the '''AI Fighters''' that died. The \"Remaining\" AI Pilots found on the far right of the '''Fighter Control Center''' tells how much \"AI Pilots\" are on your disposal inside your carrier, as said before, you have to respawn your carrier in order to regain the AI Fighters that you lost.\
|[[File:FighterDead.png|left|]]\
|-\
|'''Occupied'''\
|If a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] is occupied by another player, it will show as a red outline over the '''Fighter Infobox''' that the other player is currently piloting. \
\
These Fighters can still be overridden by giving the Fighter an AI Pilot command, but the player piloting the Fighter will be kicked out of the pilot seat and will fall off. Be wary of this status when you have players controlling many of your Fighters.\
|[[File:FighterOccupied.png|left|]]\
|-\
|}\
\
\
\
=== Additional Info===\
* Fighters that are controlled by AI will have their fighter name prefix be the owner of the Carrier ''(e.g CarrierMain6969 Wraith)'', while the Fighters that are controlled by Players will have their fighter name prefix be the faction the Carrier is in. ''(e.g Galaxy Defenders Wraith)''\
\
* If a Fighter is exceptionally powerful, ''(e.g [[A - Bionicle]], [[Elanis]], or [[Hunter]]),'' it may be better to put a player instead, as they can use the fighter's full potential unlike [[AI]].\
* AI Fighters have a massive weakness, where if it gets too close to its target, it will turn around, possibly losing most, if not '''All''' of its firepower, until it turns around again after moving a moderate distance away from its target. ''(This Behavior is explained in detail in the page [[AI]])''.\
* Sometimes, your AI Fighters will lose interest/wander off the target that they are attacking/guarding, so be sure to click the Attack/Guard command often even if the command is set.\
* It is not recommended to leave your [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier's]] pilot seat, as the AI Fighters can possibly have their set commands be removed.\
*When an AI-Controlled Fighter attacks an enemy, you will be put into a \"Hostile\" state whether your Carrier has attacked or not, at any distance away. Interestingly though, this does not happen with Player-Controlled Fighters when they attack an enemy.\
*Combat Reward is given in full to the Carrier owner when an AI-Controlled Fighter with accumulated CR destroys a ship. But the accumulated CR will be lost if the AI-Fighter carrying it is destroyed before it's target is destroyed. For Player-Controlled Fighters, the Combat Reward is instead given to the Pilot of the Fighter instead of the Captain of the Carrier that houses it.\
===Known Bugs===\
*AI Fighters sometimes forget their commands when they destroy a ship. Best example of this is when an AI Pilot destroys a ship during a guard command, afterwards it will wander off from its guard spot aimlessly.\
*AI Fighters that are recalled are known to cause a bug where the [[:Category:Carrier|carrier]] goes up to the recalled [[:Category:Fighters|fighter's]] top speed (e.g. [[Nimitz]] having [[Interceptor F|Interceptor F's]] top speed), caused by getting on a recalled AI Fighter, and then the pilot getting in the seat.\
* When a Player-controlled Fighter is recalled, via the Recall Fighters button separate from the Fighter Control Center, and the Pilot inside the Fighter stays, the next time the Captain sets a command to the occupied Fighter, it will move and execute the command despite being occupied and the Player-Pilot may be left stuck welded on the carrier or fall off. It is also not shown the red border despite being occupied in that state.\
*When an AI Controlled Fighter returns to it's Carrier and becomes docked, it will be impossible for a player to pilot that Fighter as it will keep booting you out of the seat, even though no AI is controlling the fighter anymore. \
*When using AI Fighters and one of your AI Pilots die, you will lose credits depending on how powerful that Fighter is, but this credit loss is usually negligible, up to only 200 Credits max.\
==Acquisition==\
*'''AI Fighters''' costs 300 robux each. Once bought, it acts as a permanent \"slot\" able to be used with any carrier's fighters and remain even if the fighters are destroyed.\
*The [[Galaxy VIP Gamepass|VIP Gamepass]] gives its owner 1 '''AI Fighter'''. \

==Version History==\
*Available in version .73f for a short time, and was quickly removed.\
*Re-added in version .74a.\
*Price increased 250 -> 300 .76c1\
==Trivia==\
*Before '''AI Fighters''' were released in version .74a, it was common for [[rcouret]] to test '''AI Fighters''', but when '''AI Fighters''' were being used in that situation, any players that joined that same server would be unable to join any faction no matter what.\
*The most amount of '''AI Fighters''' that can be owned at once is 13, presumably due to [[Nimitz]] having the most fighters at that number.\
**This does not include the 1 '''AI Fighter''' you get by purchasing VIP.\
<references />\
*The '''AI Fighters''' feature is somewhat controversial among the Galaxy community, as it is seen as a way to \"Pay-2-Win\" [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] such as the [[Nyx]], [[Prometheus]], [[Kapisi]], [[Hailstorm]], and [[Retro Nyx]]; because it turns those ships from strategic tools dependent on in some cases an entire team to function effectively, to monstrous flagships capable of easily overwhelming the defenses of bases, destroying them or any ship unfortunate enough to be on warp cooldown while near such a ship equipped with AI Fighters.\
*A planned way to acquire AI Fighters without Robux was to trade 1 [[Red Diamond]] to a computer in the Sales Floor of [[Mega Base]]. It is unknown on whether this will be released or is cancelled.\

The '''''Shady Dealer''''' is a quest NPC previously used to give out [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]].\
== Description ==\
The '''Shady Dealer''' was a hidden vendor NPC that sold [[:Category:Advanced Ship|advanced ships]]. His location and the ship that he sold changed every month.\
\
During the [[April Fool's Event 2020|April Fool's Event of 2020]], the Shady Dealer was \"killed\" and gave out the [[Baby Tyrant]] as his \"final sale.\" The new rotation ship NPC is [[Eduardo]]. ''Please move to Eduardo's page for current information on rotation ships.''\
\
During re-release of the [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]], he was one of the two [[:Category:NPC|NPC]] quest merchants that sold the prototypes. The '''Shady Dealer '''used to sell the [[Prototype X-1]] for 6 Million Credits, and 1 [[Weapons Part]].\
== Prototype Rebirth ==\
Just like with the [[Shady Alien Dealer]], the '''Shady Dealer''' used be found somewhere in [[Myriad III]] through a teleporter in the [[Mega Base]] (left Alien Embassy door). The teleporter itself used to become active after [[Myriad III]] was upgraded to planet level 3. During this period, the shady dealer sold the [[Prototype X-1]].\

* During the Prototype Rebirth, just like with the [[Shady Alien Dealer]], if you attempted to scam the '''Shady Dealer''' for the [[Prototype X-1]] without enough of the needed Credits and materials, you would not only be denied access to obtaining the ship, but your materials would be taken out of your [[Warehouse]].\
* During [[Halloween Event 2019|Halloween 2019]], the '''Shady Dealer''' was reintroduced into the game and given the functionality of selling [[:Category:Advanced Ship|advanced ships]]. This has been the '''Shady Dealer's''' purpose since.\

"Aliens","==Description==\
'''''Aliens''''' are one of the only two enemy AI Factions in the game, the other being the [[Pirates]]. Any ships affiliated with the Alien faction will attack any ship or [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]]/[[:Category:Planets|Planets]] that is not their same faction on sight, at a minimum of 15,000 studs away from them. They can also attack the enemy AI faction [[Pirates]]. \
\
All of the alien ships currently in the game are made and used by the [[Kneall]], but during the past events, other alien factions, such as the [[Avellian]], temporarily replaced the [[Kneall]].\
==Alien Fleet==\
The Alien ships that currently spawn naturally are the following: \
{{ShipLink|Swarmer}}\
{{ShipLink|Kneall Bruiser}}\
{{ShipLink|Kneall Outrider}}\
{{ShipLink|Punisher}}\
{{ShipLink|Decimator}}\
\
The Alien ships that currently don't spawn naturally are the following: \
\
{{ShipLink|Kneall Bionicle}}\
{{ShipLink|Kneall Prototype}}\
\
*Small alien ships spawn in groups of 3-5 at random locations on the map.\
*Large alien ships spawn alone at random locations with the exception of the [[Decimator]], which instead, spawns at the top of the [[Mega Base]].\
*Recent updates have limited the number of '''Alien''' ships that can spawn in one server to 20, but they can still build up considerable groups with enough firepower to destroy even the strongest [[Starbase]]s.\
*Alien ships that are [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]-class or larger have the ability to call all aliens currently in the map to their aid, and can target [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]] and [[:Category:Planets|Planets]]\
*All Alien ships can spawn in Private Servers.\
== Ship Stats ==\
Aliens tend to focus on shield damage, with the exception of the [[Decimator]]. \
\
Note: All alien ships, from [[Swarmer]], all the way to the [[Kneall Prototype]] have a fixed damage resistance of 30%, regardless of ship class.\

==Planet Capturing==\
[[Punisher]]s and [[Kneall Bionicle|Kneall Bionicles]] can command alien fleets to capture and assimilate [[:Category:Planets|Planets]] just like player factions, and can cause a server shutdown if it targets (and destroys) [[Mega Base]]. Although other aliens don't target the planet when they come to close proximity, when the mentioned ships calls the aliens on the map to assist them to attack a planet, they will. \
\
Once a Planet is captured, it will have a bright green color in the Map along with the current territory it's occupied with. Aliens targeting the planet when it was captured may linger at planets after taking control instead of warping away, making it difficult to retake the planet.\
\
If the planet is heavily defended by '''Aliens''' and/or upgraded, a single [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] may not be enough to take it back. It may take more than one faction's limit of Dreadnoughts and multiple sieges to take back a heavily defended Planet taken by a spawned Kneall Fleet.\
\
You can also use a captured planet to your advantage by using it as a lure making it easier for Aliens to come to you, ''(Keep in mind that you must only have a maximum of a Level 1 Planet in order to do this.)''\
\
\
==Version History==\
Version .65b saw the introduction of four new Alien ships; the [[Outrider]], [[Kneall Bruiser|Bruiser]], [[Kneall Scout|Scout]], and [[Kneall Prototype]], said to be a weaker [[Prototype X-2]]. These ships, along with the original two aliens ([[Swarmer]] and [[Punisher]]) were able to be spawned at Myriad III when fully upgraded.\
\
Version .67c Gave the [[Bruiser]], the [[Outrider]] and the Kneall Scout can now spawn in the map. \
\
Version .69b saw the [[Halloween Event 2020|Halloween 2020 Event]], The Aliens were changed for the duration of the event to [[Alien Serv|Servs]], [[Alien Scourge|Scourges]], and much more. Once the event ended, the [[Kneall Scout|Scout]] was permanently removed from the game. Previously, the ships had the word \"Kneall\" in front of them, making their full name \"Alien Kneall Bruiser.\" The Outrider and Bruiser were recently changed to just say \"Alien Bruiser,\" marking their faction and their ship name.\
\
Version .69e saw the introduction of the Alien ship, the [[Decimator]]. This ship spawns after a certain amount of time has passed. It has the highest amount of health out of all aliens that can spawn in the game, making it a formidable enemy. It can also call other aliens to its aid, like the Punisher. The [[Judgement]]'s build menu description mentioned it over a year ago, but it was only recently added. It's power is comparable to a [[Rift Guardian]].\
\
Version .75a10 saw the [[Kneall Event]], Which introduced alien starbases such as the [[Devastator]] and the Kneall Outpost which they will be removed for the conclusion of the event. This event also introduced the [[Kneall Bionicle]] which was an identical counterpart to the player-ownable [[:Category:Battleship|Battleship]]. These new alien enemies were around until the conclusion of the [[Kneall Event]].\
\
Version .75a27 increased [[Punisher]]'s spawn limit to 2.\
\
Version .75a37 made [[Decimator]] pacifistic against [[Mega Base]] ''(Unless targeted by [[Punisher]])'' and no longer spawns on top of [[Mega Base]].\
==Trivia==\
*Most Alien ships have a purple trail.\
*It is possible for '''Aliens''' to assimilate a [[Starbase]].\
* '''Aliens''' and [[Pirates]] will fight each other.\
*Interestingly, the [[MRLS Launcher]]'s engines resemble that of Alien ships.\
*A full alien swarm should not be underestimated, A [[Punisher]], [[Decimator]] and all the other Alien ships can even force a [[Lucifer]] to retreat.\
*Since the gatling update, all aliens have gatling Turrets, making the server quite laggy during swarm.\
*The [[Decimator]] is the only alien ship with a different icon color than all other non-event aliens.\
*The Decimator does not have its faction name in its name, making it seen as \"Decimator\" in game.\

{{Outdated}}\
''This page details faction-generated Starbases. For a general list of all starbase structures found in Galaxy, go to the [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase Category]] page.''__NOTOC__\
[[File:Starbase menu3.png|alt=|thumb|336x336px|The current Starbase Menu]]\
'''Starbase(s)''' are the center of operations for player factions and serve as a spawn point for the players in every faction. '''Starbases''' are crucial for factions, as they are the places where [[Ores]] can be [[Mining|dumped]], [[Trading|sold]], and [[Trading|bought]].\
\
'''Starbases''' also serve as safe houses for players as a place to dock and despawn their [[Ships]]. When a '''Starbase''' is destroyed, the [[Factions|faction]] it belongs to is also destroyed, unless the faction owns other bases or [[:Category:Planets|Planets]]. The '''Starbase''' generates credits based on the amount of power and territory it holds. At the start of the game, it has around 70 credits (0 in [[Galaxy Arcade]]). '''Starbases''' are stationary and are assigned a random position on the map when their faction is created. All [[factions]] and '''Starbases''' are color-coded. When you walk near the center of the '''Starbase''', you are greeted with the '''Starbase''' menu, from which you can open the ship menu, buy and sell items, access a menu to teleport to other bases, loan credits (which isn't available in [[Galaxy Arcade]]), change [[Factions]], and open tutorials. Faction leaders also have additional controls over certain aspects of their '''Starbases'''. Even though the '''Starbase''' may seem safe, ships docked there may still be damaged, unless they are freighters or miners that have not been in combat recently. The '''Starbase''' has an explosion radius of 150 (level 1), 195 (level 2), 254 (level 3), 330 (level 4) and 429 (max level). The '''Starbase''' also has a 11% chance of having ore/artifacts in the loot when destroyed.\
\
'''Starbases''' serve as both the main target and main point of resistance during [[Sieging|Sieges]]. All '''Starbases''' have turrets, but higher-level '''Starbases''' are significantly more powerful. '''Starbases''' also generate [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] that players can use to defend, with [[Starbase Fury|Furies]] at level 1 and 5, and [[Starhunter]]s at level 3. From most ranges, '''Starbases''' deal significant damage to both [[Shields|Shield]] and [[Hull]], but at long range, a '''Starbase''' generally deals less damage to Hull than to Shield (which is why many [[:Category:Siege Ship|Siege ships]] like the [[Ridgebreaker]] have more Hull health).\
== Starbase Levels ==\
A '''Starbase''' can be one of 5 levels. Higher levels increase the stats and capabilities of the '''Starbase'''. Increasing the '''Starbase''' level also allows higher classes of ships to be spawned. Please note that the player must also have a certain amount of '''[[loyalty]]''' to spawn more powerful ships.\

}}\
=== '''Level One''' ===\
A newly created faction will start off with a level one '''Starbase'''. At this level, the '''Starbase''' has four docking ports and can only house four players. The '''Starbase''' is armed with 2 [[Turrets|Heavy&nbsp;Lasers]] and 2 [[Turrets|Heavy Cannons]] mounted to the bottom of the base, as well as 2 [[Turrets|Point Defense Lasers]] and 2 [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannons]] mounted on top. A level one '''Starbase''' has 12,500 shield health and 12,500 hull health and it is vulnerable against sieges if not protected.\
=== '''Level Two''' ===\
This is the second level for a '''Starbase'''. The '''Starbase''' must have 3000 base credits and the upgrade can only be performed by the leader of the faction. Level two '''Starbases''' gain four more docking ports and a second level, which can be accessed by a teleporting elevator. They can house a maximum of six players. A level two '''Starbase''' has 13,250 shield health and 13,250 hull health. It also gains 4 [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannons]] and 4 [[Turrets|Point Defense Lasers]] mounted on top and increases the explosion radius to 195. A level two starbase can protect itself against weak sieges.\
\
This '''Starbase''' level enables the spawning of [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] and [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]].\
=== '''Level Three''' ===\
This ''used'' to be the last upgrade level for a '''Starbase'''. The '''Starbase''' must have 6000 base credits to be upgraded. In addition to being able to house up to eight players, this upgrade also adds regenerating [[Starhunter]] [[:Category:Fighters|fighters]] to a hangar in the middle of the Starbase. A level three '''Starbase''' has 14,000 shield health and 14,000 hull health. Additional armaments added are 4 [[Turrets|Heavy LR Lasers]], 2 [[Turrets|Capital Cannons]] and 2 [[Turrets|Capital Lasers]] to the top and increases the explosion radius to 254. A level three '''Starbase''' might be able to stop a medium-sized fleet if protected with its [[Starbase Fury|Furies]] and [[Starhunter]]s.\
\
This '''Starbase''' level enables the spawning of [[Prototype X-1|Proto]][[Prototype X-2|types]]/[[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capitals]].\
=== '''Level Four''' ===\
As of version .61f, '''Starbases''' can be upgraded to level four. This upgrade level requires 12000 base credits and adds another 750 health to both stats, bringing the total up to 14,750 shield health and 14,750 hull health. As of version .68b, this level also adds an additional level to the Starbase, as well as teleporters at each terminal, meaning a maximum of 12 ships can be docked at once. This level also upgrades the damage output, adding 4 [[Turrets|Point Defense Lasers]] and 4 [[Turrets|Medium Flak Cannons]], and increases the explosion radius to 330. A level four '''Starbase''' might be able to stop big sized sieges if the [[Starbase Fury|Starbase Furies]], [[Starhunter]]s and the protectors work with cooperation.\
=== '''Level Five''' ===\
As of version .68b, alongside receiving a remodel, '''Starbases''' can be upgraded to level five. This upgrade level requires 24000 base credits and adds another 750 health to both stats, leaving the base with a maximum of 15,500 Shield and 15,500 Hull health each. This level also adds one final floor to the base, giving it a maximum of 16 docking points, rounding out the symmetry of the base. This upgrade adds 4 [[Turrets|Capital Lasers]], 4 [[Turrets|Medium Railguns]] and one [[Turrets|Triple Capital Cannon]] at the top of the Starbase, and increases the explosion radius to 429. In addition, another hangar containing four [[Starbase Fury|Starbase Furies]] is added, leaving the '''Starbase''' with a grand total of 8 [[Starbase Fury|Starbase Furies]] and 2 [[Starhunter]]s for defense. At this level, a '''Starbase '''is incredibly powerful, capable of fending off powerful siege fleets if all fighters are used.\
\
\
== Making a Starbase Wealthy ==\
Rich '''Starbases''' can keep up with the [[Economy]] and quickly level up. '''Starbases''' usually struggle to stay above 9000 base credits, so if your '''Starbase''' can consistently stay above this mark, it may be considered \"rich\". There are various ways to make a Starbase wealthy.\
\
The recommended method is to set '''Orange Restrictions''' and to '''Trade''' a lot while there are no bosses, and when a boss spawns, use the '''Combat Rewards''' method ( below ).\
\
=== Dumping Ore ( Mining ) ===\
This method is the slowest method but effective. It's required to do this method first in order to do a really fast method: '''Trading.'''\
\
* If you do not know how to mine, see the [[Mining]] page.\
\
* When you have a full ore hold, dump your ore. <u>DO NOT SELL IT!</u> Selling the ore will only make the '''Starbase''' even more poor.\
*The base will gain power. The more powerful your '''Starbase''' is, the more income it gains.\
*You will also have ore in order to do the '''Trading''' method.\
\
=== Trading ===\
This method has a player buy materials from a '''Starbase''' and then sell at another '''Starbase''' for the same or higher price. So the only base losing money is the one that bought the materials from the player.\
\
The process of trading includes mining and dumping your ore. This method requires materials to be in your '''Starbase''' before following through. See the '''Dumping Ore Method.'''\
\
* Open the [[Economy]] menu and look at the prices of materials of your '''Starbase''' and compare them to other '''Starbases''', including the [[Mega Base]]. Choose a material to buy and a '''Starbase''' to sell at. You want the material you are buying to be cheaper at your '''Starbase''' than the '''Starbase''' you are planning on selling at. The '''Starbase''' also needs to have credits in order to pay you.\
\
* Spawn in a [[Ships|Freighter]], or any ship with high cargo hold.\
*Buy the material or materials you chose from your '''Starbase''', they will be loaded into your ship.\
*Fly your ship to the '''Starbase''' you decided on.\
*Sell the materials.\
\
=== Combat Rewards ===\
This method is <u>very</u> effective.  Just one attempt gets your starbase to level 4.\
\
* Wait for a boss to spawn, that is anything that calls reinforcements when attacked. The most common ships are: [[Punisher]], [[Decimator]], [[Galleon]], [[Kodiak]], and [[X-0]]\
* Spawn either a fast [[Ships|Frigate]] or a [[Wasp]] and warp to the boss.\
* Attack the boss until it either starts shooting back at you or you see the reinforcements start to warp to you.\
* Once you have the boss's attention, warp to the '''Starbase''' that you wish to get rich. The boss should follow you as well as all of its reinforcements.\
* Despawn your ship.\
* Get a [[Dragonfly]] or any ship that spawns in the '''Starbase''' and make sure the enemies are attacking you so they do not run away. Do not focus on doing damage, just dodge their fire.\
* Let the '''Starbase''' kill the enemies and the '''Starbase''' receive the combat reward for killing the enemies. This will vary depending on how many ships it has killed.\
* (Bonus) you can loot the wreckages to get valuable loot. Especially the boss ship, which will likely have [[Plasma Battery]]\
\
=== Orange Restrictions ===\
This [[Strategies|strategy]] is common throughout the world of Galaxy, not to mention easy.\
* This [[Strategies|strategy]] may not make a '''Starbase''' rich, but it can help save money. The leader simply places selling restrictions on all of the [[Ores|ore]] while still allowing people to buy from the '''Starbase'''. This helps to stop [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] from coming and selling the base into bankruptcy. This, however, will not stop miners from dumping [[Ores]] at the '''Starbase'''.\
\
=== Loans ===\
This [[Strategies|strategy]] works exactly as it sounds: money loans.\
* Simply making a loan to the base can help keep the money up. This can be done by opening the menu once in the base and giving a loan. This gives 2.5k credits to the base. These credits come from the player's own credits. After making a loan the base will pay back very slowly until it pays the full amount...and a little bit more. The player making the loan charges interest of 10% and so gets paid more than they originally loaned. The disadvantages of this [[Strategies|strategy]] are that the player must stay online and in that faction for the loans to continue to pay back. If the '''Starbase''' is destroyed before the loan is paid back then the player will not continue to receive money. Disconnecting is a large problem for people who make loans. Most players don't use this strategy because the '''Starbase''' could be destroyed and you could lose most of your credits.\

[[File:Rcouret.JPG|thumb|301x301px]][[Rcouret]] has stated that he is not going to work on Galaxy that often anymore is because the game has become too complicated. He wants to focus on a third game that will bring in more players and revenue. Galaxy probably won't be updated much from [[Rcouret]] any more, but may receive updates from the [[Galaxy Staff|dev team]]. Because of this, the implementation of such large updates as Titan-class or Repair-class ships has been significantly delayed, if not permanently so.\
<h3>'''Update:'''</h3>\
Though Titan class ships have still not been added, [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] Ships were recently implemented in version .65b. These ships are massive and quite powerful, which somewhat matches the general idea of a \"Titan\" ship. Additionally, there has been some discussion on the Galaxy Discord server of Repair-class ships, but no specific details have yet to come out.\
\
Abbadon Class Titan.\
This ship was fully working and was in the dev server for a time during early 2018. It was accidentally discovered by players and lord tried to shrug it off as if it was nothing. It was never added.[[File:Download 1.png|centre|thumb|578x578px]][[File:Titan 4.png|centre|thumb|573x573px]]</div>\

When it was being worked on, players could find the turret on the [[Zero]] in [[Galaxy Development]]. It featured a fully rotatable base that would follow enemy ships that it locked on to. These turrets were called \"Bottom TestTurret2\" and \"Top TestTurret\". '''These have since been removed'''.<h3>'''Update:'''</h3>\

<h1 class=\"mw-customtoggle-Sectors shipclass\">Jump Gates and Sectors</h1>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-Sectors\" align=left>\
\
Sectors with warp gates were going to be a massive update. A lot of work was put into the update and the update was actually fully functional. It was in [[Galaxy Development]] for a time, but was later removed. There were going to be 4 main sectors in the galaxy consisting of the many different bases and [[:Category:Planets|Planets]] all spread out between them. The cancellation reason was:\
\
\"There just isn't enough communication between places and leads to all kinds of new problems. The sector stuff is coded, but I am holding off on releasing it because I simply do not feel good about. It opens a whole new set of exploits and greatly changes the flow of the game that up until now can be contained and controlled in a single server.

<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-Cityplanet\" align=left>\
[[File:City Planet.png|thumb|210x210px|City Planet]]The City Planet would have featured a massive city filled with quests, different diplomacy, advertisements, and much more. It really would have been a city. The city would have featured personal vehicle spawning (they would be a civilian class without any weapons). There were car dealerships built and everything. Developers of this project were: Uglycar, Rekuri, Ahrisama, [[Galaxy Staff|Lordmoneymonkey]], MasterPlural, and [[Galaxy Staff|Arina]].

<div class=\"TDiv shadowhover\">\
<h1 class=\"mw-customtoggle-HalloweenUgly shipclass\">Uglycar's 2018 Halloween Event</h1>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-HalloweenUgly\" align=left>\
This event would have explained what the Alien Device was actually for, as none of the staff knew anything about it until Uglycar presented the [[Galaxy Staff|Dev Team]] with an explanation shortly before an unfortunate event begun.\
\
The story would have been:\
\
Madame Death and [[Grim Reaper]], the most feared individual beings that exist, together unstoppable. For years Madame Death has been the keeper of souls lost in space and her loyal husband has been the one to fetch them for her. They've gone from solar system to the next collecting lives and increasing their influence.\
\
For many years, people have feared the [[Grim Reaper]]. They never knew who was really running the show this entire time.\
\
After the defeat of the [[Grim Reaper]], Madame Death got word and is here personally to avenge her dearly beloved. She's already killed the [[Headless Horseman]].\
\
More powerful, more dramatic and a large a ship as the prototypes with an even more terrifying feel, bringing an even darker music theme to the entire game for the duration of the event.\
\
'''Other stuff:'''\
\
You would be able to build a less powerful version of Madame Death's ship after the Halloween Event. A man would appear offering to build a ship using the same technology as Madame Death's ship if you had the blueprint. He would then tell you the location of an extremely ancient temple which houses advanced blueprints. To enter the temple, you would've needed an Alien Device. Inside the temple, there would have been a box, and once opened, you would receive an \"Ancient Blueprint\". If you brought the \"Ancient Blueprint\" and 100 \"Ancient Armored Plating\" to the man. He would build you one of the best war vessels in existence. Madame Death would drop 5 of these \"Ancient Armored Plating\" every time you killed her.\
\
'''What would have been added in the event:'''\
\
--Madame Death's Ship; As large as a [[Prototype X-2]] (old model), massive firepower 50% more than [[Grim Reaper]] and 15k/15k ship stats.\
\
--A modified version of Madame Death's ship, a little smaller both in physical size and stats. This would be given to the player for completing the main quest.\
\
--The temple (Its location not yet decided) in which the box and its quest are located.\
\
--The [[:Category:NPC|NPC]] and his dialogue\
\
--One event ship for each class Excluding [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]], custom made and themed.\
\
--Halloween themed [[Mega Base]]/other bases.\

The U.N.E. base renovation. The U.N.E. base has been abandoned for a long time. Well, it wasn't supposed to be anymore. The story would have been that after the alien threat was cleared, the U.N.E. would begin re-building the base. The U.N.E. base was supposed to be renamed to \"U.N.E. Command Station\" This would have featured multiple new quests, many new dialogues, and more insight on the entire Galaxy lore\

* '''Description:''' \"As you know when you attack an NPC base it explodes and high part count builds can lag and even crash a server if it explodes. A mothership remodel is being done and we ran into a problem.<br /><br />The model would be way too detailed to remain as a starbase so pretty much this poll is about if you would rather have a very detailed Mothership Remodel that also has a massively detailed interior that would be classed as a planet or would you rather stick to it being as starbase but it being not as detailed and having a lot of interior stripped. It is your choice. \" - SeanMorabitoYT\"<br/><br/>\"Mothership and Freedom base remodels are no longer being worked on. They have been abandoned or completely considered out because there are far more beneficial planned updates. As of now we are no longer taking requests to remodel these bases either.\" - Uglycar\

<h1>Mining</h1>[[File:RobloxScreenShot20171216_155506064.png|thumb|400px|An Industrial Miner mining Carbon Ore.|center]]\
'''''Mining''''' is one of Galaxy's core functions and is one of the roots of the economy in Galaxy. Its one of the main sources for Building ships and Gaining credits. Though mining is considered to be tedious, menial, and a grindy job in the game, as it requires lots of patience for average pay, at least for new players. \
\
Mining has several advantages over other [[Money Making]] strategies, the paramount reason being the easiest and most accessible way to grind for ships and credits, especially in a VIP Server. However, mining has several drawbacks, the standouts being that many miners are slow and take a long time to fill their holds resulting in long and boring trips for small payouts. In addition, miners are vunerable to [[Pirating]] when their Faction is in a war.\
\
Mining also adds to your score every time you dump or sell ore.\
==Getting Started==\
<span class=\"mw-customtoggle-myDivision3\"><u>'''Click this to open this section.'''</u></span>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-myDivision3\">\
To mine, just get a mining ship and click on an Ore's name box, it will light up and then when you click on the buttons for your [[Turrets|Mining Laser/Turrets]], or press their hotkey, they will start to mine, if they are in range. After a while either your Ore Hold gets full or the ore disintegrates. If your Ore Hold is full, find the nearest friendly [[Starbase|Starbase,]] preferably your own team, and dock, then open the Menu and click \"Dump Ore\". There are two options for what to do with your ore: Selling ''(You give the starbase the ores and you get credits in exchange) and Transferring (The starbase refines the ores and transfers most of them to your warehouse)''.\
<h3>'''Tips and Tricks'''</h3>\
*When mining in larger miners that can mine multiple asteroids in a single run, it's best to assign mining lasers to several ores, instead of focusing them all on the same one - this reduces the number of times you need to reassign your mining lasers, as each individual asteroid will last longer.\
*It is heavily advised to go home immediately after your team either declares or has war declared on them, as the 90 seconds of peacetime is likely your only chance of getting back to your base alive - miners don't have much health and are very slow and easy to hit, in addition to being expensive. This makes them very big targets for enemy pirates.\
*A [[Rorqual]] or [[Orca]] will assume slightly larger prices at the cost of some extra mining time. Always mine at high loyalties if you can spare the time.\
*If you're in a private server with 2-3 people, you can dump into one NPC base and keep dumping into it until you can't. Then, when you feel the time is right, you can blow up the base to collect the 10% of ore you put in. This is called '''Boom Mining''' (It's only worth doing when your base has a TON of materials).\
</div>\
==Ships==\
<span class=\"mw-customtoggle-myDivision31\"><u>'''Click this to open this section.'''</u></span>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-myDivision31\">\
In Mining, there is a dedicated class of Ships called [[:Category:Miner|Miner Ships]]. Miner Class ships are solely used for mining Ores. These ships do not have any form of dedicated weaponry and tend to be slow, and have no damage resistance, which makes them extremely weak against attackers.\
\
'''Important Notes:'''\
*Miners larger than the [[Rorqual]] CANNOT dock at the [[Mega Base]], and will show a message that you cannot dock.\
*NEVER Mine during a war, you will be guaranteed to get dived by a [[Pirating|pirate]] if you have a large and expensive miner.\
*Mining lasers can be used as weapons, however their damage is extremely low.\

<span class=\"mw-customtoggle-myDivision23\"><u>'''Click this to open this section.'''</u></span>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-myDivision23\">\
'''''Ores''''' are rocky materials used mainly to build ships and the make credits. These materials are a core part of mining.\
\
Ores have a mass which is measured in Cubic Meters, which, in Galaxy, is a measurement of how much space the Ore will take up in a ship's Ore Hold, Cargo Hold, or in a player's [[Warehouse]]. This is something to keep in mind when Trading or Mining because it can affect the amount of money players make. \
\
Each Ore mined spawns a new Ore somewhere in the server, '''however, when a server is in ''[[Endgame]]'' status, Ores will have their spawns disabled''', though ores will start spawning again '''if''' there are more than 2 Factions in [[Endgame]] state.\
\
'''''All''''' ships in the [[Build Menu]] ''(excluding the [[Wasp]] and [[Wyrm]])'' require at least some Silicate, Carbon, and Iridium. Higher tier ships require Adamantite, Quantium, Titanium, and Palladium as well as Uranium.\
=== Locations ===\
'''Common Ores'''; Silicate, Carbon and Iridium are found commonly scattered throughout the map of Galaxy. These ores also spawn in a large cluster near [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]] and [[:Category:Planets|Planets]].\
\
'''Rare Ores'''; Adamantite, Palladium, Titanium and Quantium, are only found in what is called a '''Quadrant'''. A Quadrant is any of the four parts into which a plane is divided by rectangular coordinate axes lying in that plane. In this case, axes that separates the Quadrants is called a ''Dead Zone'', in which little to no rare ores can be found. More explanation can be found below.\
\
'''Uranium Ore'''; Uranium Ore, a unique type of ore, is found scattered all around the map just like Common Ores, but is much more scarce and harder to find.\
\
\
\
\
[[File:OreQuadrants.png|thumb|right|Rare Ore Quadrants, showing the Dead Zone as red.]]\
In the image shown on the right, the map highlights the 4 Quadrants on the 4 Corners and the middle square being [[Mega Base]], these are where Rare Ores of each type spawn on each one of quadrants. The Red Zone shows where it is not possible for Rare Ores to spawn. Keep in mind that 2 Types of Rare Ores '''cannot''' spawn at the same quadrant ''(e,g Palladium and Quantium at the same time cannot be on the magenta quadrant''). \
\
''Note: Rare Ore types are not fixed in 1 Quadrant, instead they are randomized after each round reset or server reset.''\

<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-myDivision13\">\
[[Loyalty]] is a large part of mining because it affects how much ores you receive during every dump.\
\
When mining, for example, A small mining laser mines 2.5 mass of ore per second, and every medium mining laser mines 5 mass of ore per second. The number of credits paid by your base, or dumped into your warehouse for ores is worked out using the following formula: (1.29+Loyalty*.8) * Mass\
\
For instance, if you have 10% loyalty and a hold with 5000 mass of ore inside, you do (1.29+.10*.8)*5000, which gives you 6850 credits \
\
The payout of ores increases with higher loyalty: \

===Territory===\
Mining is used to bolster the territory of a [[:Category:Starbase|Starbase]]/[[:Category:Planets|Planet]], and make it rapidly expand often for many reasons including assimilation, Starbase Income, or pushing to [[Endgame]] early. \
===Money Making===\
There are several Money Making strategies which can give more than normal mining, and can be found in the [[Money Making]] page.\
</div>\
==Version History==\
*[[Loyalty]] now affects the percentage of ore that is transferred into your [[Warehouse]] via this second dump ore option in version .64h.\
* Version .64h, players can transfer 14% of their mined ores into their [[Warehouse]]. This method makes dump to the warehouse more profitable than selling to a starbase after about 11% [[Loyalty]] and is recommended for new players in the game, although it is still a viable option for all players to use, especially at higher loyalties.\
*Ores were remodeled in version .66b by bomb_pops.\
*Loyalty was capped at 33%, Causing a mining strategy known as High-Loyalty Mining to be less effective in an unknown version\
*Rather than immediately halting upon endgame, ore respawns are halted only when fewer than 3 factions remain, as of version .69b.\
*Ore asteroids were made slightly larger and now contain more raw material as of version .70a.\
*Ore prices for bases have a fixed price floor of 3.5x the mass of the ore; Mega Base ore prices auto-adjust based on normalized quantities as of version .70a.\
*Ore gained a lighting effect later on in version .75a4.\

Do these quests only if you're looking to build a ship and there's no available Uranium in [[Mega Base]], or if once in a blue moon, the sell price of Uranium becomes higher than 34 Credits in [[Mega Base]].\

==Trivia==\
*Originally, there were only 2 BM Plasma battery quests located in [[Pyramus]], but they were relocated to [[Mega Base]] due to the events of the past [[Kneall Event]].\
\
*If a player was to run a 4 Hour Server and kill+loot all the bosses that spawns during that time-frame, they would get ~70+ Plasma Batteries ''(~280000 Credits+)'' every 4 hours. The most coming from [[Punisher]].\
\
*Plasma Batteries have a value of 4000 Credits per piece derived from the BM Plasma Battery quests.\
\
*Players used to be able to duplicate Plasma Batteries. This made Devs disable the Buy/Sell of Plasma Batteries to any [[:Category:Starbase|Starbases]]/[[:Category:Planets|Planets]] due to how much it was exploited.\

The '''''Advanced Ship Computers''''' are a group of Computers used to sell [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]], and are only the source.\
==Ship Rotation==\
Advanced Ship Computers undergo what is called a '''Ship Rotation'''. Ship Rotation decides what [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]] should be On-sale and Off-sale for the month. This makes [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]] have a semi-limited status.\
\
=== Ship Rotation for this month: [[Helios]], [[Atheon]], [[Nightmare]], [[Zhen]]. These Ships are currently on-sale.===\
==Quests==\
===<span style=\"color:#FFFF00\">NOTE that the [[Borealis]] quest is NOT given in the computers, instead, it is found in this [[Borealis Quest|Page]].</span>===\
All 7 Advanced Ship Computer quest-givers are located in <span style=\"color:#8b0000\">Terminal D</span> <span style=\"color:#FFFF00\">[SALES FLOOR]</span>, inside the [[Mega Base]] grouped near one of the windows.\
\
Each Advanced Ship Computer has an image icon of an [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]]. This dictates what [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ship]] it sells.\

==Version History==\
*Some of the '''Ship Computers''' were disabled, in version .66b excluding those for the [[Galaxy]] and the [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]].\
\
*[[Mega Base]] Remodeled in version .75. Due to this, [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital]] Computers were removed, and all Ship Computers were remodeled to have a pinkish style.\
==Trivia==\
*[[Borealis]] is the only Advanced Ship to not be sold by the computers.\
*The '''Ship Computers''' in Terminal D replaced the dining hall room.\
*The [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruiser-ship]] [[Bombe]] has an identical appearance mimicking the computer.\
*The Dialogue on some of the Advanced Ship Computers is identical of that from [[Shady Dealer]], a past seller of [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced Ships]].\
*Before [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|Super Capital Ships]] were moved to the [[Build Menu]], they were previously sold at the [[Mega Base]] at computer dealers, and did not require [[Permits|SC Build Permits]].\

A massive hub located in the center of the map the '''''Mega Base''''' supports a variety of functions.\
=Description =\
The '''Mega Base''' is a super-sized [[Starbase]] added in Galaxy Beta with 100k Shield, 30k Hull, and 75% Damage Resistance. It is where players spawn upon entering a server or when their own bases are destroyed, go to build ships, access their [[Warehouse]], and buy or sell materials at a steady price. The Mega Base is unarmed and neutral to all player factions. If it is somehow destroyed (e.g. [[Aliens]]), the server will shut down. \
\
Mega Base follows similar docking rules to [[Factions|Faction]] Starbases, allowing [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] or [[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] ships to become invulnerable while safely docked, though this invincibility wears off when the respective ship becomes undocked or engages in combat. Ships of any class cannot be spawned at the Mega Base except for ships under [[:Category:Battlecruiser|battlecruiser]], and although non economy-related ships may still dock, they do not benefit from any sort of invincibility.\
\
Mega Base's [[Ores]] storage, [[credits]] and prices are linked across all servers, even [[Galaxy Private Servers|private servers]]. Mega Base Credits fluctuates between positive and negative meaning in times of debt any Ores/Materials cannot be sold resulting with \"Base does not have enough credits to buy this.\" and combat rewards are not paid fully due to \"insufficient funds\".\
=Interior=\
'''Mega Base''' has a total of 5 terminals (A, B, C, D, and E), A total of 18 docking ports (3 docks in terminals A-D and 6 in E), and in each terminal a second floor: '''LIBRARY''', '''SALES FLOOR''', '''UNE SUPPLY DEPOT''', and '''AUDITORIUM''' respectfully (Terminal E does not have a second floor rather it has the \"core\" of Mega Base). At the center of each terminal is a pad that teleports players to the main hub.\
\
The main dome of the Mega Base is decorated with flora, \"beaches\", and pillars designed similarly to tree trunks without leaves or branches. It also houses the [[Galaxy VIP Lounge|VIP Lounge]] between terminals A and B a glassy 2 story building with a \"VIP\" sign above the second floor door, between terminals A and D sits the alien embassy at the bottom floor with no stairway or sidewalk leading to it, and at the very center on a floating island lies the community boards, teleporters to each terminal, a physical icon set in stone, signs floating above each terminals catwalk, and a sidewalk around the perimeter. A teleporter behind the physical icon labeled observatory teleports the player to a small glass room floating above mega where it overlooks all of mega and the surrounding space. A holographic tree sits on top of a pile of stones below the floating island. The ceiling consists of a semi transparent glass covered in recognizable constellations. \
\
There is a large sign that cycle through different \"ads\". Players may use robux to purchase their own ad slot to display any roblox group/place they choose (within the limits of roblox filters). Ads may be displayed on rotation for 1 day (50 robux), 3 days (100 robux), or 7 days (200 robux).\
\
===NPCS===\
'''SAD-OS''' is an NPC character located next to the [[Quests|Smith]] NPC in the '''Mega Base'''. It appears to be an unusable red teleporter on top of a crudely-made potato. Upon interacting with it, it will speak: \
\
[SAD-OS] \"My name is SAD-OS and I am a potato.\"\
\
On top of the fact that this is a very blatant reference to the character PotatOS from [[wikipedia:Portal_2|Portal 2]], there is nothing more to add. \
\
[[Luca Sky]] and [[Billy Ray Joe]] are at the center of mega base. Luca stands at the top of a pillar between terminal B and C while Billy Ray Joe stands next to the rules board.\
=Mega Base Announcements=\
About every ?? minutes in the '''Mega Base''', you can hear what sounds like a robot speaking on an intercom throughout the Mega Base. These are all of the sentences she says:\
\
<small>Note: This was a pain to do and all I came up was a gallery format which removes the slide bar. -Happywolf2341</small>\
=Tips and tricks=\
*If you plan to transfer items or sell and buy items at '''Mega Base''', make sure you are not at [[War]]. Pirates normally do some [[Pirating]] at Mega Base and normally attack any enemy ship they see, mainly [[:Category:Miner|Miners]] and [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]].\
\
*[[Aliens]] normally head to Mega Base, so be warned and look at the [[Minimap]].\
\
*Smaller Pirates always stay within 30,000 studs of the Mega Base, so be careful when trading and keep an eye on the Minimap.\
=Getting Inside=\
As is commonly known, if you warp perfectly, you can enter '''Mega Base'''. It takes some practice, but it gets pretty easy over time. But, two players named [[User:FRJRyanYT|FRJRyanYT]] and '''Parzi3l''' have found a new way to get inside. Where the terminals connect to the Mega Base, there is a small, rhombus-shaped, hole that is just big enough to fit, maybe 3 [[Wasp|Wasps]] going through at once. All testing to enter using '''Frigates''' has shown us that most '''Frigates''' are too big to enter using our area, but to be honest, we only tested two Frigates. Photos of the entrance will be shown below.\
\
= Trivia=\
*Ads were formerly used only by game staff or developers to launch their own game-related messages or ads, which included ones for the Galaxy Group, Case Clicker, Sean's Empire, and Xeiron Industries. The Case Clicker ad in previous versions read \"Come play the best Sci-Fi game around!\". This was probably based on [[rcouret]] complaining that Case Clicker is categorized as a Sci-Fi game.\
\
*[[File:MB Health-Stats.png|thumb|256x256px|The Mega Base when it had 1e22 health]] The Mega Base used to be entirely invulnerable and had an inordinate \"1e22\" (10 sextillion) health. However, as of version .73f, the Mega Base has 75% [[Damage Resistance]] and 100,000 [[shields|shield]] and 30,000 [[hull]].\
\
*Around 6:00pm UTC Pacific Time 3/23/2022 Admins spawned a fleet of pirates ranging from normal to event ones in a server causing a frenzy, at that time Mega Base became -800k in debt, before this a group of exploiters using alts stormed the server causing a DDOS. (Direct Denial Of Service)\
\
*Some small ships used to be able to get inside the Mega Base, like [[Wyrm]] or [[Wasp]]. \
\
*In some versions of the game, the Mega Base was able to be destroyed (prior to the official implementation in version .73f). In these versions, when Mega Base died, it had one of the most destructive explosions in the game, but the radius was very low so only ships touching the mega base are affected by the resulting nuke. The wreck also had a boundless amount of loot, but the absence of the Mega Base broke the server and prevented players selling anything; the UI as a whole deteriorates as people sometimes were unable to spawn or de spawn ships. Players that joined the server were unable to join any team.\
\
*On a certain day, which is unknown for now, the Mega Base broke. It didn't sell anything, people weren't able to build ships (due to not being able to buy), and all of the materials in Mega Base had been removed. That was later to be confirmed to be due to exploiters. The developers ended up fixing Mega Base.\
\
*After witnessing the first downfall of Mega Base, it was not long until Mega Base broke again. though this time, it was more obviously the work of exploiters. As of 21/02/2020, exploiters messed with Mega Base, ending it off with removing all of the materials from said base. Players were not able to buy from mega base for possibly a week? On 27/02/2020, the game owner [[rcouret]] fixed the issue along with the development team. They also made sure to implement an anti-exploit system into Mega Base to make sure it doesn't happen again.\
\
*Before a week passed after the Mega Base patch by [[rcouret]], exploiters went around this anti-exploit system that was previously implemented. On 02/29/2020, exploiters joined Galaxy with throwaway accounts. They would give themselves an immense amount of credits, and would buy all of the materials from Mega Base and try to put the base into debt (negative credits), though due to the patch [[rcouret]] made, the Mega Base at that time could no longer go into debt. All materials dumped/sold into Mega Base were gone within 2 minutes. As of 3/5/2020, this has been patched and the Mega Base is operational.\
\
*On 11/1/2021, the Mega Base was accidentally made destructible in the main version of Galaxy, causing players to go through all the servers and kill every Mega Base until it was patched.\
\
*On 13/4/2020, the Mega Base was once again broken, leaving the base in a massive debt of negative 8 trillion credits. This has since been fixed. \
\
*Before the warp system was revised, ships were able to warp into the Mega Base with the correct timing. This was a bannable act when people used it to escape the loss of their ship in combat.\
\
*Ships didn't need to be built at the Mega Base in Alpha since the Mega Base didn't exist. This feature has since been re-implemented, allowing players to construct their ships either at the Mega Base or at a player Starbase.\
\
*On the day of the release of the advertisements at the Mega Base, the prices used to be 1 day = 500 Robux, 3 days = 1000 Robux, and 7 days = 2000 Robux. This was soon made cheaper due to the prices being too expensive.\
\
*In older versions of Galaxy, some players would “carrier camp” at the Mega Base, where they would dock their [[:Category:Carrier|Carriers]] and release their [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]], allowing them to fight without the Carrier losing its invulnerability. This was patched later on though, with invincibility being switched off when Carriers launch Fighters at the Mega Base.\
\
*[[File:Ship in the MegaBase.png|thumb|270x270px|Grievion inside of Mega Base]] The original model of the Mega Base used to have F and G terminals beneath the E terminals, but they were removed for part reduction. It is believed they were deemed unnecessary as the Mega Base very rarely gets that crowded.\
\
*Inside the Mega Base, there is an Alien Embassy, as well as a chart with character translations for the alien language. Players cannot enter this structure, as occasionally announced by the Mega Base. More information about the Embassy can also be found in the [[United Nations of Earth|Lore of the U.N.E.]]\
\
*[[File:Advisor board (3-11-18)-0.png|thumb|220x220px|Community Advisor (now removed) in Version .63]] As of version .63f3 (ish), there a \"Community Advisor Board\" was added to the Mega Base, showing update logs and announcements for Galaxy. This has since been removed and was replaced first with an advertisement for the U.N.E., and later with the rule and update boards.\
\
* [[File:New MB boards.png|thumb|Boards as of version .75f]] In version .63h1, a rule board and an update log board was added at the place where the Community Advisor Board was located at. In-between the two is a smaller board promoting this very Wiki. These boards have essentially the same function as their predecessor, but separate new rules and new game updates. The Community Advisor Board was moved behind the Alien Embassy, however it has since been entirely removed.\
\
*Before the implementation of features such as universal credit totals and variable/demand-based ore prices, the Mega Base used to be the most difficult base to bankrupt of all its credits. This was due to Mega Base's price being fixed at a low price in the Economy Matrix; only Frion I could set prices lower than Mega Base.\
\
*[[File:Viper Display.png|thumb|150x150px|Viper on display]] The latest model of the Mega Base (as of version .73f) has a [[Viper]] displayed on a stand near Terminal D.\
\
*In an unknown version, Mega Base invulnerability was removed, and [[:Category:Alien|Aliens]] are now able to attack it. If the '''Mega Base''' is destroyed, it unleashes a very powerful nuke upon exploding (which destroys most bases and ships in the vicinity of the explosion) and the server is shut down; with the message, \"You failed to protect the crucially MegaBase. This galaxy is no more. Please play again!\"\
\
* Currently has one of the largest explosion radii in the game, at a value of 4500 or a 40,500 stud radius. Many have lost their ship to the '''Mega Base''' exploding, so if it is under attack; take care to be aware of if it is exploding, or your ship may be exploded along with the '''Mega Base'''.\

"Economy","\
<div class=\"cardcontainer\" style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;\" align=\"justify\">Galaxy has many ways to make money, each with advantages and disadvantages. Knowing when and how to work for credits will greatly help you progress in Galaxy. Each dropdown tab details a specific strategy for making money. Individual pages are also dedicated to [[Mining]], [[Trading]], and [[Pirating]]. For getting a profit, see Crashing The Market.\
<div class=\"TDiv shadowhover\">\
<h1 class=\"mw-customtoggle-MiningStrat shipclass\">Mining</h1>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-MiningStrat\" align=\"left\">\
Mining is the root of the economy in Galaxy. Without mining, trading cannot be done. Mining involves using a [[:Category:Miner|miner]] to mine asteroids before dumping the [[Ores|ore]] to a starbase (including [[Mega Base]]). Dumping ore is a miner's way of selling the ore it has collected, and ore in your hold cannot be used for anything else. Mining is slower than trading, but also much safer (assuming that you mine around your own base). Miners fuel the economy and help to keep it alive. Because miners are not armed; they can be a big target; so it's best to keep your miner around your own base - this also helps reduce travel time.\
\
When mining, every small mining laser mines 2.5 mass of ore per second, and every medium mining laser mines 5 mass of ore per second. The number of credits paid by your base for ores is worked out using the following formula:<br />\
(1.29+Loyalty*.8) * Mass\
\
For instance, if you have 10% loyalty and a hold with 5000 mass of ore inside, you do (1.29+.10*.8)*5000, which gives you 6850 credits\
<h3>'''Tips and Tricks'''</h3>\
*When mining in larger miners that can mine multiple asteroids in a single run, it's best to assign a mining laser to several ores, instead of focusing them all on the same one - this reduces the number of times you need to reassign your mining lasers, as each individual asteroid will last longer.\
*It is heavily advised to go home immediately after your faction either declares or has a war declared on them, as the 90 seconds of peacetime is likely your only chance of getting back to your base alive - miners don't have much health and are very slow and easy to hit, in addition to being expensive. This makes them very big targets for enemy pirates.\
*A [[Rorqual]] or [[Orca]] will assume slightly larger prices at the cost of some extra mining time. Always mine at high loyalties if you can spare the time.\
*If you're in a private server with 2-3 people, you can dump into one NPC base and keep dumping into it until you can't. Then, when you feel the time is right, you can blow up the base to collect the 10% of ore you put in. This is called '''Boom Mining''' (It's only worth doing when your base has a TON of materials).\
<h3>'''Advantages'''</h3>\
*The payment is consistent and doesn't rely on the economy being good.\
*Ores can often be found very close to the base, especially in newer factions, meaning mining is fairly risk-free.\
*The ores generated through mining can be sold for considerably more than the base paid for them, meaning if you then sell them to another faction (or the Mega Base), you can make a lot of money for your faction - this is the primary source of income for most factions, and the main way of getting a strong faction started.\
*Mining is the best way to accumulate lots of a specific ore inside a starbase to lower the price of that ore for trading.\
*Is a great way to get some quick cash if you ever need a boost. \
<h3>'''Disadvantages'''</h3>\
*Ores can sometimes be very far from the base, especially in older factions, or if you're exclusively mining a single ore in order to try to lower its price.\
*When mining far from the base, it can sometimes not be possible to get back to your base within the 90 second grace period before a war begins.\
*Miners will have a harder time dealing with enemies such as aliens, as they have little firepower to deal with them.\
*Pirates may declare war on you wanting to destroy your miner.\
*Uranium is rather rare or nonexistent in some public servers, so it cannot be consistently mined.\
*Bases can't have negative credits anymore, so you need to wait for your base to gain enough credits before you can sell your ore. Until then it is better to transfer your ore into your warehouse.\
*!!! Ores no longer spawn if there are only 2 teams left on the server during endgame.\

<h1 class=\"mw-customtoggle-TradingStrat shipclass\">Trading</h1>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-TradingStrat\" align=\"left\">\
Trading can be one of the most effective ways to make money. It involves buying [https://roblox-galaxy-official.wikia.com/wiki/Ores_and_Materials Material] from [[Starbase]]s and selling it to other Starbases (including the [[Mega Base]]). [[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] are the primary ships for trading due to the ships' massive cargo holds. Leaders sometimes avoid having their base bankrupted by putting selling restrictions on their Starbase. The restrictions on selling and buying can be viewed in the Economy tab. These restrictions usually don't last after the base has been upgraded to level 3 or 4. The most common way to trade is to buy the cheapest ore available in the economy (ideally at your own base) and sell it to Mega Base. Trading can be much faster than mining but is also harder to set up. Also, without using ships with large cargo holds, trading can bring lower profits than the average mining run.\
<h3>'''Tips and Tricks'''</h3>\
*The best way to lower a price in the economy is to mine a lot of that ore and dump it at your station. In order to prevent players from buying the ore before you've gotten the price as low as you want it to be, it is important to lock the purchase of that ore.\
*Silicate is always the best ore to try and lower the price of, since all prices decrease at the same rate, but the profit made on silicate increases faster in comparison to the other ores, as more can be carried in a single cargo hold, and more is mined by miners.\
*An important fact to remember is that the economy updates at a rate of 0.1 every 5 minutes, which means changing the price of an item by 1 will take a minimum of 50 minutes. Naturally, this makes planning important, and if you intend on reducing a price for trading then it's important to start early.\
*If you can access them, planets ([[Frion I]], [[Aqueous II]], and [[Myriad III]]) are a very powerful way to get low prices as it has lowered ore prices by default, which bypasses a lot of the waiting required to get a good price. This is especially true on [[Galaxy VIP Servers]], as you can make several factions until you get one that is close to one of them, meaning the process of capturing the planet is much easier.\
*If the [[Mega Base]] doesn't have enough credits, you can buy ores from the Mega Base into your warehouse, and then swap servers to sell them again to a different Mega Base. This can be used to transfer vast amounts of credits from one server's Mega Base to another at almost no cost to the player.\
*Uranium is great for trading since the difference in the Starbase price and the Mega Base price is larger than any other material.\
*Keep in mind that ship holds are based on weight rather than on ore amount. This may make certain ores more profitable to trade than others.\
'''<<CRASHING THE MARKET>>'''\
\
If there happens to be an extremely large number of plasma batteries available, there is a way to get a profit from them instead of not buying them. Buy as much plasma batteries as possible, and do the plasma battery quests in terminal D, and sell it's uranium. 1 plasma battery=125 Uranium, which is well over 3.5k credits compared to the cost of a plasma battery, which is 3k credits.\
\
( PROFIT! )<h3>'''Advantages'''</h3>\
* Credits can be made '''very''' quickly with good prices.\
* It can increase your faction's power (and therefore territory), and supply the faction with credits to buy base upgrades. This may become vital in a server where other factions have already leaned towards hostility.\
<h3>'''Disadvantages'''</h3>\
* A good economy that allows trading to be used efficiently can be very difficult to come across.\
* If you are at war, or if war is declared whilst you are in the middle of a run, you can lose your ship, as freighters are often flimsy and have no weaponry. This is '''very''' expensive, as freighters are expensive and losing your freighter with a full hold will add a lot more money to your losses. This problem can be avoided entirely through the use of [[Galaxy VIP Servers]] if you have access to one.\
* If war is declared, trade becomes extremely dangerous and almost impossible, and any good prices in your base are impossible to make use of. This problem can also be avoided if you have a VIP server.\
* When trading, you need to have enough credits to fill your hold, which can be problematic for particularly poor players.\
=== '''Profit Calculation''' ===\
* This section is designed to help understand how much money you will make by trading.\
*Profit is calculated using this formula: (Selling Destination Price - Buying Destination Price) * (quantity of item held)\
**Example: Silicate E-Class: (4.5 - 3.5) * (10000) = 10000 Profit.\
=== '''\"Priming\" The Economy''' ===\
* Starting an eco-server is often done by putting money into a base that you plan to make an active trade hub. This is so people can buy and sell certain quantities of material without the base losing too much money.\
*This can be accomplished by buying a considerable amount of materials from a base and selling to mega base at a net loss. While this is not ideal initially, it allows you to start trading earlier. You can easily make your money back later.\

=== '''Tips and Tricks''' ===\
* '''This is the most dangerous way to make money and is NOT recommended for newer players'''\
* If you are new and want to dip your toes into making money through combat rewards, starting off with killing aliens swarmers and alien bruisers is a good way to learn basic combat, just be sure not to lose your ship!\
* Be in a team with a sizable fleet, that way you and your teammates can take down large ships with much more ease. Teamwork is key.\
* If sieging, stay close to your team's fleet or the enemy may target you for being alone.\
* Follow your fleet commander's orders, if they're telling you to retreat, you should probably retreat.\
* Don't take on larger ships by yourself unless you are in a ship of the same class. Even then, check the minimap frequently in case there are other sneaky teammates waiting to strike you when you're low.\
* War is much more common in larger servers\
* Joining war servers that are in endgame will boost the rate you gain loyalty by 1.5x, so it's better to join those kinds of servers for some kills.\
=== Advantages ===\
* Gets you more familiarized with the game's unique ships and current meta.\
* Teaches you how to properly fight against another player, which is amazing knowledge to have in this game.\
* Unlike mining or trading, combat rewards aren't grindy and is a fun way to make credits.\
* Being in lots of fleets will teach you which players to avoid.\
=== Disadvantages ===\
* If not experienced enough, you might lose large amounts of credits through ship destruction.\
* Requires lots of skill and knowledge in the game.\
* Players may hold a grudge towards you and target you if you were responsible for killing one of their valued ships.\
* A lot of players will run away once they're hulled, making you miss out on potential combat rewards.\

<h1 class=\"mw-customtoggle-PiratingStrat shipclass\">Pirating</h1>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-PiratingStrat\" align=\"left\">\
[[Pirating]] is a more dangerous way of making money, involving the destruction (and looting) of freighters and miners for money, and occasionally including the claiming the bounty if the target had one. Pirates usually use small fast ships that can kill miners and freighters quickly without taking heavy damage from the base lasers. Common ships for pirating include the [[Cobra]], [[Sixfold]] and [[Gideon]], and wealthy pirates may use an [[Ampharos]] for some tasks. Pirates normally attack miners and freighters due to the fact that these ships are unarmed and are expensive, with freighters usually carrying a lot of additional loot in their cargo hold. Most pirates have a decent sized bounty, making them fairly easy to spot.\
\
Late game pirates who are more wealthy and familiar with the game often picks up common behaviors from certain players. Using all of this to their advantage they are able to pick out armed capital ships to pirate to gain even more wealth from the large wrecks Dreadnoughts and Carriers can leave behind. These pirates also can lay out a trap and specifically target something they lay eyes on to secure their goal and profit from it with the least casualty.\
\
Many pirates will switch factions frequently in order to pick on the weakest targets, making them poor faction members as they're very likely to backstab their allies (this used to be a major threat but this has died down since the loyalty update)\
<h3>'''Tips and Tricks'''</h3>\
*Ships as big as carriers and dreadnoughts can be targeted by pirates if the pirates are in a group, or if the dreadnoughts have just left a large battle, such as a base siege.\
*Occasionally it can be profitable to lose a ship whilst pirating if you manage to kill your target, especially when the target has a bounty. (Using your own ship explosion can be a last resort in finishing off a low target)\
*As miners and freighters are often big and slow, spinal based ships like the [[Cobra]] are good at killing them.\
*Cruisers like the [[Nidhogg]] can slowly use its spinals to pick off the miner or freighter's shields and use it's flak cannons to easily finish off the ship.\
*Taking the time to familiarize yourself with common behaviours of certain players and new players can allow you to create better decisions and predict what you can do.\
<h3>'''Advantages'''</h3>\
* Pirating can be fairly easy, especially when targeting miners far from their base.\
* The enemy ships are normally unarmed.\
* Pirating can bring in a lot of money very fast if it goes well.\
* Pirating is fairly cheap to start, as strong pirate ships are very cheap in comparison to miners and freighters (such as the Cobra or Gideon).\
* When using a small ship with warp, it is usually easy to escape if a large ship comes along, making it fairly risk-free if you're careful.\
* If you want to gain a high bounty, pirating is a great way to increase it, as most of your targets will not have a bounty of their own.\
<h3>'''Disadvantages'''</h3>\
* Pirates can sometimes be easy to spot due to decent bounty, losing you the element of surprise.\
* Pirating requires a lot of patience.\
* Players may remember you and may announce the fact that you're a pirate to others.\
* Many players will look down on pirates with distaste.\
* Some players may hold a grudge and want revenge.\
* If failed miserably, you can lose large amounts of money from ship destruction.\
* Many players escape to their starbase as soon as a war is declared, making it difficult to get to them.\
* It can be difficult to hurt other players while they are warping away.\
* It takes a while to gain enough loyalty.\

<h1 class=\"mw-customtoggle-ServerStrat shipclass\">Server Jumping</h1>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-ServerStrat\" align=\"left\">\
Server Jumping is very similar to trading. Players try to buy the cheapest [[Ores|ore]] they can find before transferring it to their [[warehouse]]. From there, the player jumps around servers until they find the highest price for that [[Ores|ore]]. It's best if you have a Freighter and a large [[warehouse]] for this [[Strategies|strategy]]. Another way players may use this is by selling to the [[Mega Base]] in another server instead of going to another faction.\
<h3>'''Advantages'''</h3>\
* Because the prices extend multiple servers, '''HUGE''' amounts of money can be made.\
* Very little [[pirating]] can be done to you because you're spending little time on each server.\
* Because you're checking multiple servers, you're almost guaranteed to have the best prices at the current time.\
* You have the ability to find the ores needed to build capital ships.\
* You can save your entire server economy\
<h3>'''Disadvantages'''</h3>\
* The one trading must already have enough money to buy [[Ores|ore]] from a base.\
* [[Pirating|Pirates]] may destroy your ship. (Assuming that you are at war with another faction.)\
* Factions may have selling restrictions.\
* Your ship will likely be unarmed (assuming that you are using a freighter), unless you are using the [https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/Constellation Constellation]\
* A good economy that allows trading to be used efficiently can be difficult to come across.\
* Wars can end trading quickly.\
* You can bankrupt and destroy other server economies (especially if you manage to bankrupt the Mega Base )\
* It can take insane amounts of time, possibly more than simply trading.\
* The Credits reset to 7500 everytime you get back on [[Galaxy Arcade]]\

<h3>'''Battery Duping'''</h3>\
When certain NPCs are killed (e.g. Galleon, Decimator, Punisher etc.), they will drop Plasma Batteries. Each one takes up 1000 units of cargo, so an Argonaut is the minimum requirement to start. Once a Plasma Battery is looted, the player has to travel to Mega Base, where they can transfer it to their warehouse, then head to Terminal D of Mega Base. There will be stairs leading up to the old Advanced Ship Shipyard, and there are 3 quests, each exchanging batteries for uranium. Completing the quest will remove the battery from the warehouse and deposit uranium of various quantities (100, 300 or 1250 depending on the quest). Afterwards, the player can sell the uranium to a base in exchange for credits\

Still looking for where current year galaxy is\
\
Rough background of humans in space:\
\
-Resource shortage on Earth from poor management of resources, the year is 3,000 \
\
-Political conflicts over resources and U.S. comes out on top\
\
-Nasa makes an expeditionary spaceship to travel the galaxy in search of habitable worlds and available resources\
\
-Ships are sent out into a resource rich system once it was found and start establishing permanent, space-bound infrastructure\
\
-At first, rather than settle permanently on a habitable world, humans stay in space constructing starbases and structures while mining comets and asteroids for the necessary materials to suit their needs. Later on some planets are terraformed or settled on permanently.<h1> United Nations of Earth</h1>By the year 3383, the Earth had been ravaged of its natural resources. Scarcely any of the planet's mines had been left untouched. The Earth was bled dry, pits and shafts stretching deep into the crust, bare of any minerals or fuel. Many industries on Earth fell into ruin, unable to support themselves due to excessive energy costs and pitifully low production rates. The crisis continued to intensify at an alarming rate, but just as the worst economic and resource depression in history loomed at the edges of human society, a spark of hope shone from NASA: An asteroid system filled with countless valuable resources had just been discovered not far from Earth. Every pure element humanity could have ever needed could be found there, and even some that humanity never thought they may need. Thus, a new age dawned on Earth.\
Soon after this amazing news, frivolous work and research were started on interstellar space travel, beginning with the initiation of NASA's Interstellar Space Program, also known as the I.S.P. After the economic collapse, crowds of people desperate for work flocked from all around the globe. This immense workforce allowed the first mission of the I.S.P., Project Constellation, to be launched just a few years after the program's initiation. Project Constellation saw enormous success. This gave NASA a glimpse of the true potential in continuing such advancements in technology, inspiring them to redouble their effort in research and engineering. A mere decade later, fully equipped mining and cargo ships were ready to launch towards the asteroid field. Christened “The Voyager Armada,” all ships within the fleet were equipped with brand new warp drives, which had been developed only a few years prior. This huge technological advancement shortened the original travel time to the asteroid field from 36 years to mere hours.\
\
Soon after the voyage was underway, the majority of governments on Earth realized that if the fleet were to encounter an entirely different species, they would need to have a unified representation of their people. An invite was sent to every leader on the globe, and the largest meeting of world leaders ever recorded was held at the United Nations headquarters in New York. The result was the emergence of the United Nations of Earth (U.N.E.), a unified global government with representatives from nearly every nation.\
The first project headed by the U.N.E. council was the construction of a space station to serve as a base of operations and refueling for all future missions, as long-distance travel and delivery were still extremely costly. The base was constructed over a period of 3 years, and after completion it became the central hub for miners and traders in the asteroid field area.\
\
\
Aqueous II was originally discovered by a stray miner that wandered far off-course. The U.N.E.S. Harvester had been assigned to a deep space mining operation due to its advanced warp drive, but the pilot abruptly changed course when considerable amounts of radiation were discovered near the planned ore field. Having already exited warp within a few kilometers of the field, the pilot was in a rush to escape and re-activated his warp drive without the proper calibrations. This mistake sent the misfortunate Harvester hundreds of light-years into the unknown.\
As the pilot knew all too well, deep space can be equally tranquil and terrifying. Coming straight out of warp space makes it even worse. A pilot could find themselves in the midst of a meteor shower, or they could have warped too close to a star, or heaven forbid too close to a black hole (not to mention the extreme radiation these objects give off). Yet, out of all the catastrophes that could have occurred, the pilot stumbled upon a rather benign, interesting discovery. The miner had warped near a blue, spherical object that he quickly assumed to be a planet. The pilot knew that most planets that had been discovered near other ore fields were dull husks of rock that were quickly scavenged by mining corporations for the iron and nickel in their cores. But this seemed different. The miner first thought that this planet was a gas giant, and as such, it would be a bad idea to enter its atmosphere, as wind currents or a powerful storm could easily overcome the Harvester's maneuvering thrusters. But as the miner approached, it became clear that the planet was much too small to a gas giant, and the persistent nagging of curiosity overpowered rash thinking as the miner approached the planet's outer atmosphere.\
\
The miner slowly descended upon the planet, only to find that it was actually terrestrial and covered in snow. Making the conclusion that the strange but elegant color was simply a trick of the gases in the atmosphere, the miner continued to explore. As he approached the surface, he could make out grey stones and a few high peaks like mountains, all covered in snow. Excited by this new, terrestrial planet, the miner sent signals far and wide to scientific and exploratory divisions as well as the U.N.E.\
\
Within hours, the planet was surrounded by over twenty scientific research vessels. Scientists used a geological scan to confirm that the planet was completely terrestrial, and also not geologically active. This made it quite unusual for mountains to have formed. The scientists also discovered that underneath the icy surface, much of the planet was covered in oceans of fresh, freezing water, much like Jupiter's moon, Europa. Taking into account the sheer amount of water the planet held for its mass, scientists named it Aqueous II. Soon after the initial scientific scans, the U.N.E. took official measures to continue research on Aqueous II and began constructing a base for scientific and military operations. Soon, this planet not only became a formidable base, but also a central station for fresh water for ships from all over the Galaxy. As well as water harvesting, mining began below the planet's icy ocean, as a large amount of ore had been discovered there with further scans.\
<div style=\"background-color: #111212; border: 1px solid #252828; box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px #0C0D0D; margin: 10px; padding: 5px;\">[[File:S Aque.PNG.png|center|thumb|485x485px|The Planet Aqueous II]]</div>Sadly, this happiness was short-lived. Following a rather uneventful decade on Aqueous II, the U.N.E. Abruptly began a full-scale evacuation of Aqueous II. Few reports came through to the public, but rumors began to spread that an alien species had threatened the base on Aqueous II and had effortlessly disabled a defense perimeter in the nearby asteroid field. Whatever the cause, Earth recalled all military starships and began to heavily fortify, as if for war. The U.N.E. was gearing up to be ready for anything that came its way. The public never heard from anyone at U.N.E. Command about what really happened. For those among the U.N.E. Command, the mystery was surpassed by one existential realization: If the aliens ever realized the true location of Earth, a massive war would surely ensue, a war in which likely humans would almost certainly lose to such an advanced race.\
As the years continued to pass, space agencies continued to develop new weapons and ships, all aimed at the military. There was no greed, there were no countries and their borders. There was just “us” and the rumors of “them.” Earth and whatever else lied in wait in the vast depths of the Galaxy.\

<div style=\"background-color: #111212; border: 1px solid #252828; box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px #0C0D0D; margin: 10px; padding: 5px;\">[[File:Aqua Abandoned.PNG|centre|thumb|618x618px|The Planet Aqueous II]]</div>On July 13, 3407, The U.N.E. passed sweeping precautionary legislation to protect the location of Earth. All major military and mining operations were required to be at least 10 light-years from Earth to prevent the aliens from discovering its exact location and bringing the war directly to the central command of the U.N.E.\
As military development continued, the U.N.E. started classified work on a “Prototype” Mega-starship. Construction would take decades. Rumors of the ship began to spread, many of which claimed it would have enough power to repeal an entire fleet. As the government continued to centralize in order to control resources and move them into the military, rebel factions who did not agree with the U.N.E. merged into one and took off into space. From there, they spread out and began causing trouble to U.N.E. starbases and patrols for the foreseeable future.\
In the midst of the Prototype's development, there was a top-secret mission: The construction of a Mega Base in the heart of the asteroid field the U.N.E. had first fled from after the Aqueous II incident. Utilization of the bountiful resources in the field meant construction was swift, and the Mega Base was completed in just under a year. The Mega Base was equipped with the largest shield generator in history. The hull was strengthened and thickened to the point that not even an entire fleet could breach the base's walls. Over time, the Mega Base became a massive trade hub for later stations set up in the asteroid field. The rebels organized a general peace with the U.N.E. (though some pirates refused to back down), and the Freedom Base was constructed. Xeiron Industries, an independent company, created Sambhyre Research Station. Its original purpose was to explore the feasibility of new fuels and power sources through portable uranium processing and refining in the depths of space. After a deadly scenario leaving the station in shambles, Xeiron Industries had little motivation to carry on their research. In order to prevent a complete reactor shutdown, if they should ever need to return, the heads of Xeiron began to give out loans to traders or anyone that could supply small amounts of fuel to the station. No further attention has been paid to the station, and it has become a broken, derelict place, apart from the occasional overnight trader looking for a loan.\
As the years continued to pass, a new planet was discovered in the asteroid field. The U.N.E. named it Frion I and constructed a base in the heart of the rocky planet. They also set up considerable orbital defenses if it were to ever be attacked.\

Growing numbers of rebels were breaking the Freedom Base treaty, and Pirates were beginning to host raids on the dozens of Starbases. The Freedom Base became a heavy target, as the Pirates saw it as a representation of the mistakes of their predecessors. The constant piracy crippled the Freedom Base's ability to sustain and defend itself. Some Pirates took the initiative and destroyed all of its remaining defenses in hit-and-run raids. Others stormed the base and claimed it as their own. Other rebels and some people from Earth became independent from both the U.N.E. and each other. They farmed their own resources and established their own Starbases, becoming rather powerful independent factions. As the number of factions grew, they established trade routes, designating the Mega Base as a neutral trade hub for all factions.\
<div style=\"background-color: #111212; border: 1px solid #252828; box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px #0C0D0D; margin: 10px; padding: 5px;\">[[File:Pirates-icon.png|centre|thumb|300x300px|A Rogue Pirate]]</div>In the year 3420, three unidentifiable, heavily shielded vessels entered Asteroid Field. Fearing the rumored aliens had finally arrived, nearly every station initiated compulsory defense readiness for their fleets, all of them prepared to fight for their lives. Strangely, these vessels never attacked, instead heading directly for the Mega Base. One of the ships docked and a group of vaguely humanoid figures walked inside. They were aliens. The Mega Base Commander approached the group of aliens cautiously, his guards at the ready. Both sides were extremely uneasy. Eventually, the Commander spoke up in a wary voice: \"What is it you are doing here?\" The tallest of the aliens approached slowly before responding: \"We are the Slarfie. Our kind is split into two sides: The peaceful Slarfie and the vicious, warlike Kneall. We were driven from our home planet and have no home. We wish to stay here, if you would allow it\". The Mega Base Commander spoke with U.N.E. Command over a restricted subspace channel. After heated debate, the U.N.E. agreed to let the so-called “Slarfie” stay, leading to the creation of the Alien Embassy. In honor of the location of first contact, the headquarters of this Embassy was established inside the Mega Base, beside the terminal where the Slarfie first appeared. The Alien Embassy was closed to all humans so as to avoid conflict. The U.N.E. passed a law allowing friendly alien species like the Slarfie to live as citizens of Earth and to make homes on any other U.N.E. controlled Bases or Planets.\
<div style=\"background-color: #111212; border: 1px solid #252828; box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px #0C0D0D; margin: 10px; padding: 5px;\">[[File:SlarfieEmbassy.png|center|thumb|620x620px|The Alien Embassy]]</div>''*An unknown amount of time passes. The U.N.E. is currently in active conflict with a Kneall fleet on the outer edges of the asteroid field*''When the U.N.E. fleet arrived, they chased the last remaining Kneall fighter until it warped away. Though many of the fleet were eager to give chase, feeling empowered by their new weaponry, the flagship issued a recall to all fighters. During the chase, a scout ship had discovered a strange distortion near the edge of the battlefield. As the fleet approached, some of the fighters disappeared from sight. Through subspace communication, they managed to establish that the fighters had entered the atmosphere of a cloaked planet! They were amazed by the discovery. The planet had what appeared to be an alien military testing facility, but it seemed to have been abandoned for decades. The U.N.E. named the planet Myriad III. The cloaking generator has since been deactivated. Using the scrapped wreckage of alien fighters, the U.N.E. managed to create a prototype version of the ship, utilizing a combination of alien and human technology.\

They suspected the Kneall had damaged their base. They immediately began construction on a ship unlike any other. A ship that could take on fleets of fleets of enemies and emerge unscathed. After 4 years of building, the U.N.E. Subjugator was born. With secondary shields deflecting anything that dared touch it, it was the ultimate defense ship with advanced turret weaponry.\
==The Kneall War of Sector 552==\
The Kneall had indeed destroyed the Facility, and the U.N.E. was oblivious to the fact that they would start a war. In Myriad III, they had restored a Kneall communications radar and sent a war declaration. In order to avoid the destruction of other Starbases, and ultimately, the Mega Base, they battled in sector 552. The Kneall were successfully driven back, with the help of the U.N.E. Subjugator and a few Hevnetiers supplied by the Slarfie. Most ships were destroyed during the battle, the rest of it remaining history.\
== Uncovering Frion I==\
After the battle, many pirates scourged the wrecks for loot. They were not disappointed. They had found a new artifact left behind by the Kneall: a Core unlike any other. So shiny! They had to keep it. But during a U.N.E. raid on the Pirates' Starbase, it was taken away for investigation. Soon, people began finding more and more of these so-called Kneall Cores, and eventually, they had a use: to make ships that crossed the limits of what U.N.E. once thought was impossible. It didn't take long for the U.N.E. to get their hands on one, and with new, dangerous ships such as the Osiris, Zhen, and the Atheon, the U.N.E. decided to build a ship based on the precursor technology from a Kneall Core. After 3 years of manufacturing, trial and error, and scourging the wrecks once again, they built the Obliterator: a restored Kneall warship that would restore peace at the disposal of the U.N.E. With this, they also discovered a map of the Galaxy, and later, they would find a burning-hot planet called Frion I. \
==New Alliances Begin==\
With more new technology being found, bounties were placed on Kneall ships. Soon, the Kneall rarely appeared to attack, much less raid. But the Kneall were secretly making a ship worthy of legend. Soon it was finished. But it wouldn't be long before the U.N.E. found out about the project with a Slarfie spy. The Eradicator was coming. The general public was also making new, humongous manufacturing companies for warships, freighters, and miners. One of them in particular, Event Horizon Manufacturing, to be exact, signed a deal to make a ship that mirrored or at least countered the strength of the Eradicator. Soon, the Astraeus was mass-produced, and the U.N.E. was once again prepared for battle. \
==The Triple-Race War==\
During the second Kneall-U.N.E. War, The Eradicator and it's weapons and comrades were wiping several astraeus out within a matter of minutes. But there were too many. But suddenly, the Pirates appeared. They too, wanted control of the galaxy, it was clear that all 3 were against each other. The U.N.E. saw the Kneall and Pirates as a threat (And they were, of course), The Pirates saw the U.N.E. and the Kneall as a threat, and the Kneall thought the U.N.E. and the Pirates were a threat. And so, it was between 3 major groups to practically destroy each other. The Pirates came well prepared, with their army of Kodiaks, Jormungands, and Dragoons. The U.N.E. and the Pirates won in an unlikely team, and later signed the treaty of peace (ToP).\

\

This is the truth behind The Galaxy Civil War that happened on 08/25/2018 (Or 25/08/2018). I am putting this on the Wiki so you guys know the truth about what happened, so I don't get suppressed, and so '''Uglycar''', '''MasterPlural''', '''Tis_Jake''', '''MinisterKappa''', '''Rekuri''', '''Destroyer878878''', '''Docplayznba30''' and '''Mr_Swagical''' are all remembered for the services they did for Rcouret to help Galaxy and Field Of Battle.\
\
'''<u>(PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS WAS NOT A REBELLION LIKE WHAT PURPLE SAID IT WAS. WE ONLY PLANNED ON SPEAKING TO RCOURET ABOUT HER. THATS ALL WE PLANNED; SPEAKING TO RC).</u>'''\
\
Around 1 week previously to this date, I, [[:User:Seanmorabito|Sean Morabito]], started talking to some of the Field Of Battle staff on the Field Of Battle Discord Server. They called me over to ban a user who was raiding their server since I was one of the only people who had ban and kick permissions. I banned said raider and asked the staff why they didn't have their perms. I also had to fix a bunch of channels that were broken because people couldn't talk because, once again, the Field Of Battle staff didn't have permissions. ''(This is getting somewhere I promise)''. They told me that Purple had removed their permissions for no reason so I said in the main chat that removing their perms is really stupid and that I would DM Purple about this because what's the point in staff if they can't do their job. Now to me that is a pretty harmless message. Around an hour after I said that, I noticed my Porter role (Which was the staff role) on the Field Of Battle Discord was gone. I asked Purple why and didn't get a solid response for quite a while since she kept trying to change the subject. Purple even moved it into the Galaxy Discord Staff Chat. Finally (Not in her own words but pretty much what she said) I was told that I was removed for no reason. She had also told the FOB Staff that I was busy with RL and that was why my role was removed, but this was a lie.\
\
I went on to say that I only ever wanted to help and so on. I started talking more with the Field Of Battle staff and learned that they had similar problems going on with Purple there. They told me that if you spoke your opinion, you would get removed from staff. On that server, she had all the power to herself (except for the FoB Admin Director). When I talked to the Field Of Battle Staff again, they told me I was removed for speaking out against Purple (if you can even call that speaking out lol). I asked if I could get my staff roles back but was rejected. Princess, the FoB admin director, said that Purple and her could handle the server on their own (If that was the case why did the FoB admins ask for my help lol?). The field of battle staff than sent me pictures of a lie Purple had told the entire field of battle staff team. I quote, \"Guys, Sean has been porter helping out on an emergency basis.\" \"He's very busy in irl and with Galaxy so don't ping him or dm him asking for server support.\" \"Just spoke with him and just don't ping or dm, or mention him.\" He has even received role request from players\". (Meaning that I asked for the \"players\" role lol).\
\
Now, this was a total lie and it just made me enraged to see her do this to me when all I wanted to do was help out. She did this to me for no reason. This was the spark for me starting the group and bring us together. This wasn't the only reason we tried to talk to Rcouret however. Oh no, there were many, many more. Many of you might know about a lot of previous things she had done, like in 2016 when MasterPlural and Falloria were removed from Galaxy Staff for no reason and Purple lied to all the players by saying that they left on their own. This, in fact, was not the case. The next false demotion I remember was Rekuri. He was still a very active admin even if his shipmaster duties didn't apply that much. That doesn't change the fact that he was still active. Instead of moving him down to admins, Purple completely removed him from staff for the sole reason of \"Inactivity\" which also was not the case as he was an active admin.\
\
I also remember one time when Winter was on a staff channel with Purple talking about getting mad and kicking someone from the Discord server. (I don't remember the details exactly but I remember the kick being valid). Purple comes in out of nowhere not knowing the situation and demands that the kick was false. Winter kept telling Purple that it was a valid kick but Purple was having none of it. Winter, In the end, quit staff then and there. Winter had also created the Galaxy Bot that everyone loved to use; that project is now gone. Purple had the final say in anything.\
\
Purple once told Uglycar and I, \"I took the courtesy of listening to your opinions\" when Khamul was falsely demoted for voicing a negative opinion of Galaxy in another discord server! Purple isn't that active on Galaxy and spends most of her time on Field Of Battle. A lot of the time, she randomly comes into the staff chats and tried to get us to unban someone who was banned correctly even when she had no idea what they did.\
\
Do you guys remember MasterPlural and Lordmoneymonkeys' post speaking out against Purple and Arina? In the first 5 minutes in plural posting that Purple sees it, deletes it and removes Plurals roles and mutes him. A Discord riot started and Purple realized her mistake of deleting it and trying to suppress Plural when the post was already released to the public and she posted it back, said sorry to the community, got Plural to calm everyone down, gave back his roles and unmuted him. Purple acted as nothing happened after that. In the middle of all of that, I was standing up for Plural because I knew Purple had abused her power. She has held a grudge against me ever since.\
\
I also know that she has wanted me gone and I quote, screenshots Uglycar send me in a dm to Purple, \"He really shouldn't be here as far as I'm concerned\". \"If he in anyway hampers communication with staff or training with staff, he is gone.\" I was mad about what she said yes since I have done so much for this community but I kept my opinions to myself. If you spoke out your opinion you pretty much got removed anyway. Most staff were scared about that. Now there is many other incidents but I will just skip back to the present right after the field of battle server incident. This is the thing that legit made my brain explode. At this time I already formed the group with everyone and we all had our conversations and gathered evidence and we waited for Rc to get back from military training so we could speak to him. That was it only SPEAK to him, nothing else. No rebelling or anything like that. We did our normal jobs.\
\
Anyway as I was saying, this shocked me the most. I wake up the next morning with a few dms from Uglycar, Lord and Plural asking if I left the Galaxy Dev chat which I replied with no because I didn't I had been sleeping all night. I knew instantly what was going on. Purple was trying to remove me from staff. Right after I was removed she wrote in that dev chat I quote. \"Tried to send an @ Sean. Don't see him here.\" \"Uglycar: Was Sean kicked out?\" \"Purple: Sean is on staff unless someone removed him or he left.\" Now, this right here was another total lie on her part. I did not leave lol and she is the only one who can remove staff in the first place. She didn't realize this but Uglycar had access to audit logs and showed the proof to her and everyone on the server that she kicked me and lied to the entire staff team about it. \"Uglycar: Well, ya lied to me purple and I also asked plural and he said you asked him if Sean left so that means you were just playing innocent... I just want to know why? This wouldn't be the first time you lied to me but just why?\" \"I dont even know what's going on anymore.\"\
\
Since Ugly now had proof that Purple was lying she then tried to say that if I was kicked then it was an accident when it clearly wasn't lol. During this time Purple didn't respond to my dms for 3 entire days until finally, I threatened that I would show everyone in the staff chat that you falsely kicked me and lied to everyone about it. This finally got her to respond to me. (My god I've already written so much and we haven't even gotten to the main incident yet lol). I finally got added back and I just pretended that it was indeed an accident as did the rest of the staff since we didn't want to start anything with Purple. Now Purple had suspicions something was going on but she didn't know what and didn't have any proof. All we had done so far was talk together on how we were going to talk to rcouret.\
\
It was legit 1 day before rcouret returned that the most unexpected things happened. Docplayznba30, a field of battle admin so scared for his job that he decided to give Purple the Discord server link. She had around 10 seconds to look around as we started panicking and she got banned. Now keep in mind this server was only for planning and talking. We had done absolutely nothing to earn a demotion. On the Dev Server she than writes, I quote. \"Need the \"Head of the Rebellion\" to have myself removed from Galaxy and FOB and Arina removed from Galaxy to raise your hand and step forward quietly. @SeanMorabitoYT\". \"Need the second in command to the \"Head of the Rebellion\" to raise your hand and step forward quietly. @Ozumi.\" \"Need the third in command to the \"Head of the Rebellion\" to raise your hand and step forward quietly. @uglycar.\" \"All three of you are permanently exiled and may never return to staff.\" \"For the rest of you, your fate hinges in the balance.\" Now remember we had done NOTHING at all to earn a demotion. We had only planned to speak to rc about Purple and what she had been doing. We had a plan in-case something like this happened, if Purple falsely removed any of us from staff, even 1 person than the rest of the Galaxy Staff in on talking to rc would resign and quit the Galaxy Discord till Rc returned. We then set up a 2nd Discord for players and we told the truth about what was going on.\
\
In the meantime, EVERYONE started rioting on the main Discord Server like it was insane. The chat got muted so many times for a few days. When it was unmuted rioting instantly started again. I'm sure many of you remember this happening. In the end when Rc returned us Galaxy Staff and Field Of Battle Staff tried to talk to him about everything that was going on and what Purple was doing. In the end it is Rcourets game and he decides everything and I respect that and his decisions. We only wanted what was best for the game as we love it and its the reason we have stuck around for years.\
\
Nothing is being done about Purple but we were offered to come back if we wished. He made a separate staff team for the Developers so that devs wouldn't be controlled by Purple. The Field Of Battle staff, however, were not allowed to return for some reason which I think is unfair. In the end, most of the galaxy staff quit because Purple was still in power and everything slowly died down and here we are today. That is the story of The Galaxy Civil War and why we tried to talk to Rcouret about Purples abuse of power. Oh and if you want to know in recent news like a few days ago why MinisterKappa got banned it was because he said a neutral opinion and Purple false banned him, yeah. Oh rip Deadnom too. Oh also I forgot to mention during the rioting lots of people were being spammed ban hammered and soz they wont be unbanned so uh yeah rip. Thanks for reading and just remember,\
\
'''<u>NO HARASSING PURPLE OR ANYONE MENTIONED! YOU WILL BE BANNED WITHOUT WARNING! Thanks. </u>'''\

Here is a bunch of evidence that I am releasing both public and private that I think is ok to release. I have censored a few things like invites.\

\
'''From the perspective of Galaxy Discord Moderater, EB8699.'''\
\
Greetings all,\
\
I don't often play Galaxy nor do I ever really interact with so not many of you would know me.\
\
A brief summary of me would be that I worked on a game called Expedition for about a year or so, in that time I was both the sole developer that kept the game going after the creator moved onto other projects and the Head-Admin that managed staff.\
\
\
 I later went on to start a new project called Renegades that resulted in about a dozen rewrites from scratch with the most recent version being put on hold. In short, I'm a developer (Primarily a scripter) that has a lot of experience dealing with exploiters, players and staff alike. Over time I've worked on my ability to remain neutral when it comes to and/or personal topics.\
\
So I'm brought to here, after having read Sean's perspective what and how people seemed to want a less biased overview I decided I'd make my own page towards that goal.\
\
<h1>The Analysis:</h1>\
Assuming that everything Sean and the other exiled Staff said is correct, then the current administration is '''very''' corrupt and, thus they should obviously be removed. the occasional evidence provided were all screenshots, screenshots that can be Quite easily . Assuming that isn't the case though then the current administration is clearly not putting the community first.\
\
Assuming that everything said is correct, then the \"Rebellion\" was a horrible abuse of power to try and lead the community into lynching the current administration, the same point above can be said about the lack of solid evidence. Assuming/Ignoring the evidence provided was correct or is irrelevant. No community or staff member should ever incite nor in a Lynch Mob, such things never end well and are nothing more than a runaway train barreling along with everyone screaming for it faster as it goes to hit someone on the track.\
\
Assuming that neither party are correct and that it's simply brewed up because of some imagined hatred between them, this is a great example on why communication, democratic systems and freedom of speech are so essential. Ignoring, berating etc. someone's opinion just because it conflicts with yours never ends well as clearly shown, discussion with careful consideration for the opposing points and having an open mind what makes civilization run. Not rioting, yelling, screaming and having a tantrum because you didn't get your way.\
\
<h1>Personal View:</h1>\
While I mostly stayed out of the conflict, I defended purple at one particular point when there were four hundred plus people against her while she had no-one. Just prior to that I made a comment along the lines of \"Staff are there to serve the community, not control the community\" of which got significant approval from the crowds that only confirmed my suspicions about what the situation was.\
\
has made some questionable in the past, I've seen examples of where she's displayed how she tries to manipulate people. But I've also known a few people who are good in but have a similar weakness in that they use it for ill. Same can be said for being power hungry. As the Head of it was her duty to handle the staff revolt, although she didn't do that very well by publicly exiling them on the spot instead of contacting Rc or handling it in a more diplomatic manner.\
\
The \"Mob/Rebellion\" while understandably upset an, should never have happened in the first place, when it did happen they should have controlled their emotions some more instead of acting like wild apes being driven by the instinct to hurt and destroy.\
\
The staff group that collected evidence and left should never have let it get to the point that it did. They collected evidence for more than a '''Year''', a whole year they had a mountain of evidence waiting to show it. Why didn't they contact Rc sooner? Why didn't they talk about it sooner with Purple? If she demoted them then give that evidence to Rc and the community in showing how corrupt she supposedly is. Instead of sitting on their hands for so long until it finally blew up. To their credit though they did the right thing in taking their problems one level up, if you have a problem with a moderator you contact an admin, if you have a problem with an admin you contact the Head of Staff/Head-Admin, if you have a problem with them you contact they report to and so on and so forth. They did a terrible job managing a server if '''One''' person could invite the '''One''' person that should not be allowed there before your ready simply because of how explosive and destructive it would be. As covered in Sean's perspective at the top of the page, they never intended for it to be blown up into a mob. Despite it appearing that way due to the timing of the leak, it's more likely that the one who leaked it chose that particular time for maximum effect.\
\
Rc from what I recall sided with purple because he considered her a friend and offered the old staff the position of \"Developer\" so they wouldn't be under her anymore, while I probably would have done the same thing that's basically just dodging the problem. When your the one in charge you need to make hard choices that are best for the community as they are what make the game. There's bound to be a dozen other suitable for Head of Staff. How long has purple been in her position? Supposedly years. Perhaps it's time to get some fresh blood in. Perhaps it's time to overhaul the staff system so it's no longer only staff that vote staff in. A system where staff are cycled out and replaced every so often with votes by players on particular chosen candidates might prevent such in the future.\
\
All that said, did do her duty to some extent and Staff did their duty to some extent and Rc made his although it may not have been the best one. There was simply an overall lack of diplomacy. I try to serve others in all I do. In this it means the community, it is sad to see it so torn\
\
<h1>Evidence:</h1>\
I will never leak DM's nor private discussions without approval from the other party as that is a clear breach of trust. Thus all the evidence posted in the link are from the public channels and may be searched up yourself.\
\
I will ask some parties if particular snippets may be included later on.\

'''From the perspective of a player, FangABXY.'''\
\
Galaxy was not at peace. The people of general chat flurried into a riot with the sole intent: Eradicate the Gatekeeper. . . Tensions of this matter actually started several months ago, with Lordmoneymonkey creating a speech that made seen what has been behind the bright galaxy server. The staff team since then was a bust, with Lord and Plural most notably complaining about unrealistic deadlines for the game's development. . . But back to the specific event, the straw that broke the camel's back was laid. All of a sudden admins were either booted off of or left the admin team, causing a riot in favor of those who left. . . The riot was among those which were so deadly the server shut itself down to cool tensions. The tensions did not cool. A new discord server was created and everyone voiced their dislike there. Galaxy would stand still. The admins started a vote as to whether Gatekeeper should stay or leave. The votes to have her leave was nearly 10 times the votes for her to remain. . . I (FangABXY) did not see the issue thuroghly and believed that Purple could still stand in the place of leadership. The sheer strength of the opinion against me was planet-crushing. Everyone was willing me to change my vote. . . Seeing slightly more I did. . . But after rcouret returned, I in dms pleaded that he would do something to help the server. . . . The discord bot just shunned me away like i didn't exist, like i didn't matter. . . Luckily a deal was later struck and the violence ceased.\

'''From the perspective of a player, SWIU.'''\
\
The galaxy civil war was truly an unusual event that just happens to stumble upon us at the time. I was a noobie player at the time and only probably had 2k score and an m class. I heard that there was a riot going on in OGD(official galaxy discord) in the previous days and Arina had banned many of them. But then I started hears that the admins were exiled by for an unknown reason. Although I did not know any of the admins very well I still felt for them. Later that day I saw another riot gone down and the whole server was disabled by shadow. I was talking to a friend about this, who recently left DC.\
\
I said this whole thing was like WWII and I was going to be Sweden and neutral. After I gotten more details of the situation and figure out purple had exiled the admins due to disagreements. 2 admins/mods were exiled and a few left and rest stayed. Many believe the ones who stayed followed purple like a ant to food. I was trying to stay neutral but gave in when I just could not support purple from the information I gathered around the situation. I made a meme about this whole shit show. Many said that when RC comeback he will bring justice to purple but when he did, which was exciting to all he favoured his second in command over the rest of the staff. This tore apart many of the staff and it was like a nightmare coming true.\
\
Most of the DC members supported the admins and some stayed neutral. After a few days I was saddened to see some of the admins leave such as uglycar and jake. I do not hate anyone in this event. I disagree with purple and think that she cannot take massive criticism well but I honestly think riots were not needed. I'm glad that arina decided to step away from her role into the devs to help. There were terrible things that were in such event but we have to realize to let go of the past to move forward to the future. What's done is what's done. I doubt anything would change that would shock the community like this event. But keep it in the back of your mind and do not repeat history.\

"Music","'''Music''' in Galaxy is one of the highlights of the game. This page lists the current songs in the Galaxy Soundtrack.\
<div style=\"float:right; margin: 10px;\">{{#ev:youtube|8pCc-JIW_b0}}</div>\
__TOC__\
==Mechanics==\
Music in Galaxy is usually played randomly, however the music is split up into 3 categories. Peaceful, Combat, and Other. The game alternates between these 3 soundtracks depending on your situation. The Peaceful Soundtrack plays when you are not in combat (e.g. mining). The Combat Soundtrack plays when you are in combat (e.g. getting attacked by other players). The Other Soundtrack is usually played during certain events or in other situations, this category is very versatile and has a wide variety of applications.\
\
When Roblox implemented a privacy system into the audio catalog for the platform, a lot of songs used for Galaxy were privated and unable to be used in the game. The Development team prepared for the update beforehand and decided to have rcouret reupload all of the Galaxy Songs under his account so that they could be used in Galaxy. While it did work, and it saved a lot of songs from being unusable in Galaxy, it means that most, if not all, of the links to the audio's roblox page will be unplayable. You will probably have to use the reuploads found on the Galaxypedia instead.\

|Hello everyone, a concerned dad here. Recently my 16 year old son discovered the movie “Guardians of the Galaxy” after watching it at a friends house. While I didn’t mind at first, it soon began to affect his character. Within a week, he had taken a persona \"rocket raccoon\". When asked to do his homework, he called me a “stupid freaking human” father and did a strange dance. His grades have been dropping heavily since that day and whenever i refuse to give him my credit card for nitro he threatens me saying he'll \"steal my batteries\". Yesterday I entered his room to witness him listening to \"Guardians of the Galaxy Soundtrack 9 hour loop \", he has stuffed pillows under his shirt and now calls himself a \"Head Admin.\"  He refuses to go to school unless we “jump gate” there. I don’t know what that is but he refuses to take any form of transportation except that. Please I am so concerned, what do I do\

|In the case Galaxy falls from the Exploiter attack, I'd like to thank everyone for being apart of the community. While we all have our flaws and great things, that's what brought us together. We may hate each other for whatever reason, but deep down, all of us together are a large family. A family I am honored to have staff. I hope galaxy isn't removed, but I don't know anymore. If it is, hopefully we can still chat in the disc, but that's an unknown. Again, thank you everyone for the good memories, and the bad.\
Godspeed, \

|Hi, I purchased a Galaxy VIP game pass but I didn't get my galaxy, how do I request a refund? Can I have my galaxy back, plz. I bought the Galaxy VIP pass but I do not have the ship. Plz, help. I need to know how to request a refund. I don't know what to do anymore. I really want myGalaxy back but nobody is helping me, I have log proof of my Galaxy VIP purchase but I do not see the ship in my list, I rejoined the game 5 times, and had done so for the past 4 days. Is Galaxy VIP a scam? I want my robux refund instead thanks.\

|So what happens when you forget you are at war? Let me tell you the tale of Dragoslays theia. A true genius who worked with a friend to kill a Prototype x-2. In his ingenious mind, he thought it would be fine to warp to his friend, xICamm's base. In the history of Galaxy, never has there been a bigger gamma moment than this. He forgot that he was at war with the largest team in the server and promptly got dived. Succeeding to warp close to his base, he docked but just as he was about to spawn, his hand accidentally pressed the \"Buy Menu\" button, costing him two crucial seconds. And that ladies and gentlemen, is what happens when you forget you are at war\
|dragoslays\
|-\
|okay i actually have to explain myself people are shitting on me because they think i was to scared to dive the theia before the x-2. thats half true and half not. normally when i play galaxy and kill people i think about what i would do next if i would be in the other peoples position. if i was the theia i would have warped 80k in the direction of my base and then warped to mega to despawn, so the protos had warp cooldown and i could survive. this is why i waited i wanted to see if the theia gamma warps or just does a short warp. second, sure i was scared, i had no clue if i can trust shocking (xps) or if i cant. if he would have awoxed me i would have the green theia his proto and yellow sc on me. and if the theia despawned and one of our people in purple spawned his theia i would have died without having a chance to despawn\

|Well maybe if they refunded my Hype you can destroy it again some time. It was really fun while it lasted . For context I lost my Hyperion and Theia within one day of buying them because of experiences like these. I guess its all apart of the game LOL. Can't think of any reason I should be mad at this. Happy Holidays! P.S. It still doesn't show in my logs for whatever reason.\
|Cheifhayden\
|-\
|I hate war. So much. I can’t keep a single god damn ship because of it. In my opinion it ruins the game. If anyone knows of any other space-type games like this one where I don’t have to deal with being swarmed by giant war ships, feel free to message me. But I don’t think I want to play Galaxy anymore. I’m not sure why I’m telling you guys this since you’re probably just gonna be toxic like everyone else but I am anyway.\
|spellmynameright\
|-\
| You know what, screw this game. I gave it up for a reason. I get on to play for the first time in months, and my Galaxy gets dock blocked, and now I can't even get it freaking REFUNDED? I was right about this game when I left, RC is driving this into the ground. Screw Galaxy, screw this server, and screw whoever's idea it was to make Galaxy non-refundable!!\

|Hi, I am a player of your Roblox game, Galaxy, and it has come to my attention that the Nimitz has not been added back into the game. After waiting for a large amount of time, I have run out of patience. A few months back, I lost my Nimitz (and this was during the Nimitz removal), hence making me lose my Nimitz forever. Also, recently before the removal, I purchased this carrier, but then it went off sale.\
Now, here's a deal. I PURCHASED this ship with ROBUX in Galaxy Arcade, so a refund is the correct course of action, as the staff should have common sense. A refund action would be either returning my Nimitz, or giving me another ship of my choosing.\
\
If I cannot be refunded, this is unacceptable, as I spent ROBUX on it, which costs real money. No refund would force me to quit your game and report you to Roblox for scamming. I will wait for a response. I'm tired of waiting. It's been months.\
\
Sincerely,\
David (7DavidB) \

|Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth p2wlord The stupid? I thought not. It’s not a story the gammas would tell you. It’s a p2w legend. Darth p2w was a Dark Lord of the bobux, so powerful and so wise he could use the bobux to influence rc to buy credits… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even buy scs. The dark side of the bobux is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he bought everything he coukd, then his debt collection agency killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could buy any ship, but at a price\

|I find my warning in the FOB Discord (For the game called Field of Battle on the ROBLOX Platform) incredibly foolish. My intentions in the message were to ask a simple question \"Would I be instantly banned in the fob discord server if I were to recite the word known in short as the sh slur.\" I was given an answer then given a warning by a moderator, I found such harsh action(s) very unwarranted as I did not say the full word which is not bypassing. Other people (moderators I assume) who were there with me had not moderated me for it, as they saw that it was not worth the effort to moderate someone for such a small infraction. But this certain moderator whom moderated me had done the unforgiveable; moderating Sugondese who is known as the Galaxy Scripter and future Galaxy Owner. Why must I be warned for something so small? It does not make sense to me. Please, madame Blackprincess1, I ask that you remove this warning from me as I have not caused any harm to any individual through my message. If anything this warning has caused a great deal of mental suffering for me, I was shaking and crying and drinking my coca cola during the whole debate. All in all, please remove my warning. It was very unwarranted. Thank you for your time.\

|What is a Gamma Player, you ask? You don't have to be someone that plays in Gamma. You just gotta be stupid enough to lose your ships in the most unimaginable and most ridiculous ways possible. This includes sieging, diving a Super Capital alone, or just doing things that are bound to get you killed. So you see, it doesn't matter if you played in Beta, or even in Alpha. If you're inexperienced, you are a Gamma Player.\

|Today, Halloween part 2 was released! I was so happy, and I wanted to start grinding immediately. I found the requirements for the ships online, and got out of bed. I noticed something strange: all of my family's ships looked like humans! I realized SuperChip15 must have updated ships to look like your real life avatar, so I relaxed. I grabbed an Abbadon's Arrow from the kitchen side and destroyed my dog, giving me 10,000 bounty and some Souls. Yes! I was already on my way to making Prikkit! Moving on, I quickly destroyed my Gamma parents, making sure to spam L as I did. I also remembered the quests need Forgotten Souls, so I attacked my brother, and dived him when he warped out the window. After that, I went to the turret store, but was confused when all the turrets looked like guns. I guessed it was another SuperChip15 change so I bought a Dual Heavy Railgun and warped to the server's Mega Base. When I arrived, I could not believe how many ships were there! I hastily warred them and began destroying them. I laughed: I couldn't wait to check my logs! However, one Gamma used their phone to mutlibox and bait UNE to Mega Base! Even though they had turrets as well, I effortlessly destroyed them, screaming \"RIP BOZO\" at their wrecks, as I reaped more Forgotten Souls from them. Then, something unbelievable happened. The UNE Subjugator spawned! It said something about \"cease\" and \"desist\" but I didn't care, because I couldn't believe they added voicelines to Galaxy! When I tried warping away, it fired at me, destroying my ship. While it was really cool, it is extremely OP, and I lost many souls!! Thank you SuperChip15 for this event, but please please nerf UNE Subjugator!!!!!\

|Everyone, my day is ruined. My favourite Roblox Galaxy Developer and Scripter, smallketchup82 (AKA Sugondese, for those less educated) has committed an atrocious act. I woke up this morning and rolled out of my bed, then, as my mother carried me into my chair with great difficulty, I opened Discord. I noticed that smallketchup82 was hosting a Fortnite livestream. At first, I was overjoyed, as Fortnite is my favourite game, and I love all the female characters especially. However, when I joined the stream to see if I could join smallketchup82's party, I saw him taking part in a horrific practice. smallketchup82, the respected Galaxy developer, was FINISHING KNOCKED-OUT PLAYERS IN FORTNITE! In outrage, I immediately blocked him, and left the Galaxy Discord server. I've posted my story on Reddit.com and I have gotten 9.7k upvotes so far. smallketchup82 is a public menace and I HIGHLY advise you avoid him AT ALL COSTS!!!\

|Hello everyone, Rocket_GotG's trusted friend, Peter Quill here. Recently my pal Rocket discovered the video game \"Galaxy Gamma\" after playing it in his quarters with Groot. While I didn't mind at first, it soon began to affect his behaviour. Within a week, he had been \"Grinding\" and yelling \"Die Gamma\" while laughing. When asked to save the galaxy, he called me a \"Gamma A-hole\" from top of his lungs and mocked my dance moves. His life been degrading heavily and his snarky attitude grown worse, picked up many fights in a bar and whenever I refuse to give him my Units for 'robux' he threatens me saying he'll \"Blast me outta the Airlock with 'Gamma' written on my forehead\". Yesterday I entered his room, listening to \"Galaxy Gamma Combat Music\", he said \"Their music are so much better than ya choice of genre, Peter Gamma\". He refuses to save the galaxy unless we \"warp\" there. Sure, we're in a ship, but warp isn't the same as jumping... Please I am so concerned, what do I do?\

|Hi everyone. Worried coach here. I run a team for under 16's in football, and one of our team's best players has recently become hooked on a Roblocks.com game named Galaxy. One night, during a practice match, I came over and asked him if he was okay, as he was not performing as well. He told me to \"shut up Gamma\" and started shouting all about \"carnage\", \"protos\" and \"lucy\". I assume this is some sort of drug, so I immediately contacted the boy's parents. Next training he refused to take part in activities so I confronted him again. He told me that he wanted to switch teams because his team, which he kept calling his \"faction\", was full of \"Gammas\" who are \"scared to dive the ball\". He then stormed off the pitch, saying that \"he had no loyalty\" anyway. After that, he did not show up at any of our games, telling me that \"his warp was on cooldown\" or \"he was grinding for next event\". I'll be honest, I'm starting to think this \"event\" is some sort of gang thing, and I'm thinking the boy is a lost cause. Anyone know what I should do?\

|Hello everyone, a concerned dad here. Recently my 16 year old son discovered the video game “Galaxy” after playing it at a friends house. While i didn’t mind at first, it soon began to affect his character. Within a week, he had taken up \"sieging\" and \"diving\". When asked to do his homework, he called me a “gamma” father and did a strange dance. His grades have been dropping heavily since that day and whenever i refuse to give him my credit card for robux he threatens me saying he'll \"dockblock me\". Yesterday I entered his room to witness him listening to \"Galaxy Gamma Combat Music\", he has stuffed pillows under his shirt and now calls himself an \"alpha.\" He refuses to go to school unless we “warp” there. I don’t know what that is but he refuses to take any form of transportation except that. Please I am so concerned, what do I do?\

|Hey can someone tell me why my ship died here: We were attaking a base, with a proto x-1, a couple liegionarres, a tenna, and my apoc. The other team's x-1 spesifically targets my apoc, and I warp like three times away from them, and they keep chasing me to my death. why me?\

|okay so It’s a normal day and I’m being my e class that I just got on it’s maiden voyage. I’m looking around at our enemies bases. no dreads, carriers or supercaps just a bunch of low level ships. I wrap 6k away from mega and I see 1 battle ship, a dread and a cruiser or a destroyer. and instantly 2k away from my health and I’m thinking “was there a hidden super cap or something?” I warp to docking range already have jumped into and out of my seat before warping and again BOOM I’m dead. I look and see…supercoolgamerboy127’s schimitar and a solstice, dreads still on there way when I see supercoolgamerboy127 zip around like a madman like he did while his team were doing a drive on our base\
(Sorry max words) so I basically died to a schimitar and a solstice in a 10k plus health freighter in less then 30 seconds. Im super pissed of that the e class I made the same day was destroyed on its maiden voyage by a hacker in a schimitar. If you don’t believe me about the hacker then ask esylumcloud because he was there when supercoolgamerboy was speeding around our base. I’m really sad about my e class and I’m shure supercoolgamerboy127 has destroyed a bunch of other people in his schimitar already. I really want my e class refunded because I’m already broke from making the previous one.\

|Dear Rocket,\
I’m messaging you again about doman90’s demotion. He needs to be demoted immediately today he said I smelled like cheese and it brought back a flashback of a traumatic experience when the lunch lady said “no more cheese sticks left kid” it was really insensitive and he knew that he should have not said what he said. I’d also like to report Samicoo who should be insta banned because of his continuous support of doman90. Lastly is DylanTheVillain101 I believe he should be demoted and not be able to run for staff again after his continued support of samicoo and domans insolence or as they like to call it “messing around” and “jokes”.\

|Are the devs trying to ruin the game? WHY ARE YOU NERFING THE CARRIERS THE HEALTH IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES THEM GOOD\
|ManiacalBoom\
|-\
|and AI wouldn't make carriers busted IF THE DEVS actually PUT A CAP on how many you can get\
|ManiacalBoom\
|-\
|@rcouret hello yes can you nerf ai fighters because the overabundance of full strength ai fighters has resulted in the biggest break in game balance since turret standardization and has caused carriers to be nerfed into the ground so hard that many are now useless without ai fighter swarms, some carriers have been nerfed to hard to counter ai fighters that they have lost more than 10,000 health in the past month. This is not good game design.\
\
\
Making a class so strong because of ai fighter spam broke the games balance, and forced devs to nerf carriers hard. Do to carriers being nerfed so badly, many are outright garbage that get outperformed by nearly every other capital unless players buy ai slots to make them somewhat useable. No players want to pilot fighters anymore when the fighters themselves are getting nerfed and made irrelevant individually, because nobody wants to pilot warpless ships with worse damage than a destroyer when they could just spawn a battleship or battlecruiser instead.\
\
\
Literally just code something that reduces the damage of ai fighters by 50% or something, because right now this is just messing up balance and causing bad game design\

|M class is love m class is supreme. The m class is a big yellow boxy monsterous miner that  can be seen from eons away as it eats away at dozen of astroids per hour. The m class while very large has a fair speed for its size and great turning speed. However be aware while the ship is gargantuan in size its hull is very thin overall. This leaves it potentially vulnerable to threats such as pirates but thats never stopped any of its captains from getting the job done. The m class has also been known to be used as form of protest for angry captains who believe the economy is unfair and deserves a change as well such as better protection from price gougers. This has led to its infamous name known as the dock blocking device. The m class comes equiped with two m class mining lasers as well as heating and ac, but there have been rumors of other variants of the vessel being being outfitted with more advanced lasers. The control room is very small and sports no living spaces as the ship was not meant for prolonged periods away from starbases and has one huge monitor reading status online. The rest of the space on the ship is used to capture astroids and process them. safety protocols dicatate no personal is allowed in the ore hanger during the miners operation due to the risk of being crushed to death in the astroid processing bay.\

Freighter-Class ships are mainly used for transporting large amounts of materials to a [[Warehouse]]. They have massive cargo holds in comparison to other ships, but do not have any turrets. Some Freighters are also armed like the [[Constellation]].\
\
Most Freighter Class ships are very slow and vulnerable. The disproportionately large cargo holds in Freighter Class ships makes them extremely useful for looting and transporting [[Materials]]. This also makes them a big target for pirates trying to make some quick credits. \

Frigate-Class ships are the lowest priced combat capable ships available and thus are good starter ships.\
\
Frigate-Class ships are small 30 - 60 studs large, extremely fast, and highly maneuverable. They mainly have very light weaponry, very low health, and most have only 2 [[Turrets]] or fewer. Most Frigate Class ships also come equipped with [[Spinals|Spinal]] weaponry.\
\
These ships are mostly used for Scouting bases, distracting base [[Turrets]] in a siege, or distracting <u>NPCs</u>.\

A step up from [[:Category:Frigate|Frigate-Class]] ships, Destroyer-Class ships are bigger with a size range of 60 - 90 studs and have more firepower and while most are not nearly as fast as some Frigate-Class ships, they still achieve high speeds and have very good maneuverability.\
\
Destroyer-Class ships still have rather low health, but most still have much more than Frigate-Class ships. Destroyers come equipped with either [[Spinals|Spinal weaponry]] or up to 5 light [[Turrets]], making them good ships for [[Galaxy Slang|swarming.]]\

The next step up from the [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer-Class]] is the [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser-Class]].\
\
These ships tend to be very maneuverable and pack a decent amount of health. They are not as fast as [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyer-Class]] ships, but can still maneuver quite well. Cruisers tend to have light to medium weaponry, with a varying number of turrets and [[Spinals|Spinal weaponry]].\
\
Most Cruisers make very good pirating ships and can be unstoppable in the hands of a good pilot. They are mostly cheap and max out around the price of the [[Sixfold]], which costs 12k.\

Turrets are the main things for protection or for mining. They have many, many, different kinds.\
\
== Description ==\
'''Turrets''' are semi-automated weapons and utility tools found on [[Ships]] (Including NPCs like [[Pirates]] and [[Aliens]]), [[:Category:Planets|Planets]], and [[Starbase|Starbases.]] Below is a list of '''Turrets''' and all of their stats. The stats are kept up-to-date with the game files and should be mostly or completely correct. Lasers deal significant damage against [[Shields]], while Cannons, Flak Cannons, and Railguns are more powerful against [[Hull]]. Gatling and Light turrets have higher fire rates and generally better accuracy but do less damage. Medium turrets lose some accuracy but are more powerful. Heavy turrets deal high damage but are quite slow and inaccurate. Dual or Triple turrets increase the rate of fire compared to the \"single\" turret versions but also do a bit less damage.\
\
'''Base Accuracy Deviation''' on turrets is defined as the standard deviation in studs (per stud the projectile or Beam travels) from the center of a target, when there is no speed difference between the turret and target. As a general rule for turret accuracy, lower is better.\
\
'''Tracking Accuracy''' (also described as SpeedDenominator) defines how well a turret can accurately hit a target when there is a speed difference between the turret and target.\
\
The formula for calculating accuracy of a turret against a moving target is described as <code>(Relational difference in velocity between this ship and target) ÷ SpeedDenominator</code> plus the Base Accuracy. So if you're travelling at 50 speed in the same direction as your target, and your target is travelling at 150 speed, and your tracking accuracy is 10000; the difference of speed is 100: 100/10000 = 0.01. If your Base Accuracy was 0.01, it is now 0.02; which will struggle to hit small targets from a distance. It should be noted that relational velocity differences between a ship and target increase if the ship and target are not travelling in the same direction.\
\
As of version .70, Laser-based weapons deal 30% of their base damage to Hull, while Kinetic/Cannon-based weapons deal 40% of their base damage to Shields. The final damage dealt is also affected by ships' classifications, which each have specific [[Damage Resistance]] values.\
\
Turrets on this page are grouped into tables by their main types: Lasers, Cannons, Flaks, Railguns, and Utility. Sub-categories of those turrets, such as being unique to Advanced, Alien/NPC, or Event ships, are sorted as sub-headers of each main section (e.g. \"Event Ship Lasers\").\
\
The only ships that '''should''' still retain the classic or Alpha Turret models are the [[Kapisi]] and [[Hallowlight]] with their Skeletal Lasers and Skeletal Cannons, the [[Frostpocalypse]] with its Frosty Lasers, the [[Ghost of Christmas Death]] with its Ice Turrets, the [[Patriotic Rorqual]] with its Patriotic Mining Lasers, and all armed ships from the [[Retro Ship Event 2019]] / [[Retro Ship Event 2020]], however, many ships (such as [[Warlock]] and [[Retribution]]) have these models as placeholders, due to the original turrets not being available.\
\
Ships can have a maximum of 10 turrets. This was increased from the previous maximum of 9 turrets in version .71a.\
__TOC__\
== Mining Lasers ==\
Mining lasers are primarily used for mining asteroids on [[:Category:Miner|Miners]]. They can also be used as combat turrets. Generally, combat mining lasers are called \"Lances\". Lasers deal 30% damage to hulled targets.\

\
== Lasers ==\
Lasers are turrets most effective against [[Shields|shielded]] targets, and fire a red beam. They generally have better base accuracy than Cannon-type turrets, but struggle with tracking accuracy by comparison. On hulled targets, their damage is reduced to 30% of full damage.\

* Some turrets possess the surname of \"Cannon\" in their name, but are actually Laser-type turrets.\
\
== Railguns ==\
Railguns are turrets most effective against [[Hull|hulled]] targets, and have a white projectile with a trail. They boast excellent base accuracy, high damage, and long range when compared to Cannon-type turrets. However, they suffer from a long reload and '''awful''' tracking accuracy. Kinetic turrets deal 40% damage to shielded targets.\

[[File:Untitled drawing (4).png|thumb]]\
== Ship to ship combat ==\
This section compiles a list of general combat strategies in PvP. See the second dropdown menu for more in-depth descriptions of various maneuvers.\
=== General tips ===\
* When you are in combat with a ship you are familiar with, try to get out of the turrets' line of sight. For example, when fighting a [[Stormbringer]] you would want to go underneath it, because it has no [[Turrets]] underneath it, so the Turrets on top can't hit you.\
* Always keep moving as fast as you can when fighting as it lowers the chance of an enemy hitting you.\
* However, if you're looking to get big hits in dog fights don't always fly like a complete maniac, try lowering your throttle to get more hits. A dogfight is when you're using small, fast ships with [[Spinals]] as their main weapons, such as the ''[[Zero]]'', ''[[Razor Wing]]'' or any [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]]-Class ship.\
* Make sure to use your Spinal Weapons (F and G guns) during combat for a huge damage bonus.\
* When using [[Spinals]] make sure the bottom of the cursor is facing the top of the ship, if the target is moving sideways, remember to lead the target by aiming in front of them and estimating where the Spinals will hit.\
* Use your Q, E, C, and Z controls to move in a path making aiming and maneuverability easier. Best used for dog fights.\
* When fighting in and/or against larger ships, be sure to avoid enemy [[Spinals|Spinal Weapons]] and try to position yourself to maximize your firepower. Also, it is wise to avoid enemy [[Turrets|Turret]] fire. Larger ships turn slower, so therefore, if you position yourself behind and below it, you can effectively start racking up damage before they can turn and engage you.\
* Always rotate your ship correctly so all/most of your [[Turrets]] get the line of sight with on your target. If you are using an [[Apocalypse]] or [[Naglfar]], all Turrets could fire if the top of your ship is facing the target but, if your starboard were facing the target, only half of the Turrets could fire.\
* Try to stay out of combat when your shields are down. Shields slowly regenerate, but hull does not. You can repair your hull by docking at a friendly [[Starbase]].\
* Never attack a Starbase alone unless you are experienced and have a powerful [[:Category:Siege Ship|Sieging Ship]].\
* Pay attention to the [[Minimap]], the last thing you need while in the middle of a battle is to have enemy reinforcements arrive. However, if a fellow faction or ally's reinforcements arrive, you have a great advantage over the opposing ship(s). Simply watching the Minimap can be the difference between loss and survival.\
* When using fast ships like a [[Scythe]] or [[Guillotine]], move at full speed. Warp at the enemies and fire when in range. Be sure to keep moving at maximum speed to make for an easier escape.\
*Always check the diplomacy tab, never be caught off guard.\
*Never mine in a war. No, seriously, don't. I have seen someone do it during a siege, 3 Loyalists ripped his Rorqual apart, even when he docked. This will cause you to lose a valuable miner ship, and make you start all over. Stealth ships might also want to sneak up to you if you mine also, beware!\
=== Combat maneuvers ===\
==== Orbit ====\
The most basic flight maneuver is to orbit your opponent and fly in circles around each other, trying to get into a blind spot if possible. Also, sometimes only one player will orbit and the second one will be in the middle trying to turn in place and keep up with the orbit of the first one.\
==== Drifting ====\
Drifting is what usually sets the noobs apart from the pros. Drifting might take some time to learn and you won't always get a perfect drift every time. There are two ways to drift: Fixed velocity, or dynamic. Fixed drifting is more common and easier to do. To drift on a fixed velocity, start at a good speed and hold <kbd>W</kbd>. When you find the direction you want your ship to travel while you drift, hit either <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>E</kbd> depending on which way you want to drift (<kbd>Q</kbd> to drift facing right, <kbd>E</kbd> to drift facing left.) While drifting, you are free to point wherever you want as long as you hold <kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>E</kbd>. Your ship will continue to drift in the direction you pointed to at the start of the drift. In order to drift dynamically, it's best to start at top speed and click, note click not drag, a certain point 90 degrees from your current velocity. Immediately after clicking, press and hold <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>E</kbd>. What sets this apart from fixed velocity is you have the ability to orbit around your target. This is because unlike fixed velocity, when you drift dynamically, your direction is adjusted by your entire flight path changing to accommodate the new direction, keeping you always facing 90 degrees off your current path. To turn while drifting, continue holding q/e and click a new point of focus. If you don't understand that just try for yourself and it will eventually make sense. \
\
While drifting, two patterns usually arise from the fight-Orbiting and Sliding. Orbit occurs when both players are drifting in the same direction making them revolve around a certain point. Sliding occurs when both fighters slide in one collective direction in two parallel lines, this is usually easier to sustain than orbit because neither party needs to turn, meaning they cannot overdrift and collapse the distance in between them. Drifting is a very effective siege method if you are using a small fast ship with a decent hull hp because the orbital lasers will usually be the only thing able to hit you.\
\
There is a statistic in all ships called '''Drift Percentage''' found via the :info (Ship) command ''(e.g [[Zero]] has 70% Drift)''. This drift percentage dictates the max speed the ship can go through while drifting ''(e.g A Drifting [[Zero]] can only have a max speed of 80.5 due to it's drift percentage.)''. \
\
There is also a variant of drifting called Z/C Drifting where the keys Z and C replace Q and E while drifting. This is done by turning your ship 90 Degrees from its axis then doing the same steps as a normal drift, but with Z and C instead. This makes your ship drift at full speed regardless of its drift percentage, but it may be more difficult to orbit around enemies when using this drift variant. \
\
All [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter-class]] ships have a 90% Drift Percentage, while some ships have 100% Drift percentage, like the [[Helios]], these ships have the ability to drift properly while losing no speed.\
==== Weaving ====\
Since most ships have all their turrets on top and no underside defense what usually happens is orbit will start followed by a downward weaving pattern where both players will slowly spiral downwards trying to get under each other. This is where turn speed becomes an important attribute as a high turn speed means your orbit will be tighter so you can lap your opponent and come up behind and below them and wreak havoc.\
==== Micro-Warping ====\
Mirco warping is usually employed during a dread 1v1 or in a fight where spinals are the biggest source of DPS. What it is, is warping 400-1k and turning around to try to get behind your opponent in an orbiting fight or turning to deliver a head-on spinal attack. What also might happen, is a warp and flip. What that means, is after you warp to gain a bit of distance, you turn upwards so that all your topside turrets can get a line of sight at the enemy behind you. Mirco warping can also be used when your opponent is drifting in a spinal based ship. By warping right behind or next to them, you force them to stop drifting and spare yourself from the spinal fire for a few seconds. Micro Warping hard counters drifting if you opponent is spinal based, and you are turret based.\
==== Other 1v1 Maneuvers ====\
* '''Counter Orbit:''' When you find that your opponent is running circles around you in an orbiting battle, stop, and start turning the other way. Hopefully, they have too much momentum to stop before being right in front of you ready to take spinal punishment.\
* '''Ram:''' If you are a [[Spinals|spinal]] based ship and your opponent is going too fast for you, forget all flight patterns and head-on attack and try to make them bump you so they stop moving and you are facing them with spinals blazing.\
* '''Blindspot Pirating:''' If you have a ship with fast turn speed and decent [[turrets]], and are fighting a ship with only topside Turrets and slower turn speed, get underneath them and focus on staying below rather than getting all your turrets to hit or hitting your [[spinals]]. Since they can't hit you with any turrets or any spinals, eventually they will be forced to warp out, at which point you can unload all your fury upon them.\
* '''Tornado:''' The Tornado maneuver can easily take down a slow ship when used by a skilled pilot. It involves constantly running circles around the enemy ship, while still facing it so spinals can hit it, as well as getting some turret shots. Note this strategy should be used by ships like the [[Sixfold]] that have high [[Spinals|spinal]] firepower.\
* '''Border Blocking:''' Border blocking strategy is depended the pvp you are in. If your opponents turrets are top mounted go down to the border and stay there. Hopefully their ship won't be able to turn fast enough and you will get the kill. This strategy is useful against ships like Apocalypse and Nemesis.\
=== Retreating/Evasive Maneuvers ===\
Galaxy is a game where not every scenario is winnable, and it is a sign of experience to know when to fight, and when to get the hell out before you are too low to save yourself. When retreating in a fleet be aware that if the enemy is not diving someone, the last person to warp will likely get the hell beaten out of them before leaving.\
\
These maneuvers detail how to evade enemies. They are best used by ships of the [[:Category:Cruiser|Cruiser]] class and under (although some [[:Category:Battlecruiser|Battlecruisers]] like the [[Black Flare]] can use a handful of these methods)\
==== Duck and Dive ====\
This maneuver consists of flying up and down repetitively while still maintaining a particular heading. This up-down motion makes it much more difficult for enemy spinals and turrets to hit while still allowing you to reach your destination. This can only be done with a smaller, faster ship as large warships such as Dreadnoughts won't be able to move fast enough to do any good.\
==== Bob and Weave ====\
A method based more on luck than skill. Best used at close range, this maneuver consists of random slips, turns, dives, acceleration, and deceleration as to make it incredibly difficult for enemies to get into a good firing position. Pilots performing this maneuver may become lucky enough as to get behind the enemy, allowing for an excellent tactical position.\
==== Hull Skimming ====\
A maneuver used to hide from and confuse enemies. A pilot performing this maneuver would stay incredibly close along the hull of another ally ship or base and would continuously work to avoid enemies from gaining a tactical advantage and a good firing position by keeping themselves out of sight.\
=== 1v1s ===\
Most 1v1s can be won if you know what your doing of you have a ship that counters your opponent. The thing is, if your opponent is more skilled or has, say, a [[Prowler]] vs your [[Cutlass]], you may want to get out ASAP. Class can make a difference but depending on skill a destroyer can kill a battleship so you need to know how good you are and have a general idea of how good your opponent is. '''Note: While score might not be an accurate representation of skill, it is wise to proceed with caution around high scores. Bounty on the other hand, is a sign of an experienced and careful fighter. '''\
=== 2v1s ===\
Most 2v1s are a no-win situation, though there are exceptions. If your scenario is not on the following list, or you think that you are under the \"enemy\" category in a fleet of two, it would be smart to run.\
\
'''You have a counter to your enemies' ships:''' If you are, for example, flying a [[Prowler]] to fight a [[Cutlass]] and a [[Marauder]], you stand a chance because your primarily hull dps can kill the two hull tanks and you still stand a chance at winning. Another example is flying an [[Aeaphiel]] to fight an [[Archeon]] and a [[Centurion]]. In contrast to you having dps that counters your opponents' hp, now you have hp that counters your opponents' dps. That particular match up might be a bit harder to win simply because the Aeaphiel is a battlecruiser vs a battleship and a destroyer. This also applies to fighting swarms with an AA ship like the [[Ampharos]] or the [[Loyalist]].\
\
'''When your enemies are using two much weaker vessels:''' This seems kind of intuitive, but a dread should usually be able to take out a pair of frigates despite its low accuracy. This also applies when your enemies have very low hp but high dps since you can kill them quickly before the damage starts to hurt.\
== Fleets ==\
The term \"fleet\" is generally used to refer to large groups of player-coordinated ships. Fleets can be used for sieging, defense, economic blockades during war, and more. This section details the basics of fleets and fleet coordination.\
=== Fleet Basics ===\
Let us start with the basics; You are on a two faction server, 20v20 players, and on the map, you see a rather angry blob of triangles, which represent your opposing faction's most active area. In this situation, you want to stick as close as possible to the area the most of your team's ships are. If you are on your own in a relatively low DPS/support ship, and you are not covered by any [[Starbase]]s or are within easy reach of the [[Mega Base]], you are probably going to get spotted by a rather high DPS ship or group of rather high DPS ships and promptly dived on and destroyed within a minute of combat, or after a few jumps. You want to stay with your fleet, and only venture from it if you know:\
# You will have the fleet to go back to if you are counter-attacked.\
# If you are sure you can get out of a fight if a large group of the enemy fleet splinters off to attack.\
# If there is a good reason to, such as a freighter or smaller ship, which you can jump on, kill quickly, and regroup.\
Next, while in the fleet, you need to realize a few important concepts: First, the concept of the '''Tank'''. The tank can be any ship, but it always is the ship which is focused or will be focused first. This could be a ship which a rather skilled player is in, and thus is a high priority target. This could be a vulnerable ship in your fleet, say an Avalon, which is either low health or already weak to begin with. This could be a ship with poor positioning and is right on top of where the enemy fleet warped in. The tank is the ship which is most likely to be targeted first by the greatest amount of people in a fleet, and if you can identify the tank in your fleet, you can play around that. If you are in a lighter ship, say a battlecruiser or smaller, you can let the fleet dive in on the poor tank, and pick off something in the backline, or perhaps if your fleet is focusing fire, on the ship with the most amount of DPS.\
\
What if you are the Tank? Don't. If you are the tank because of the ship you are in, repair or switch it out to something more bulky. If you can't, you '''have '''to watch your health bar. Once you get around half [[Shields]], which should take a short amount of time, you need to warp away from the fight, around 5-10k, and reengage. This spreads out the damage on the fleet and is how you counter focus fire. In order to keep DPS on a single ship they will have to warp after said ship, and that temporarily makes them unable to be in combat while they warp. Consider it this way, 3 v 3 with [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]]. If one team continuously focused on one of the other Dreadnoughts, while that other Dreadnought simply warped 5k every time, and the 3 Dreadnoughts followed. They would take a considerable amount of damage from the other 2 Dreadnoughts, as they are trying to focus on the ship. That is why it doesn't happen. If you continuously cycle out who is the tank, with whoever else is the tank at the time of warping out and re-engaging every time they lose half shields, you end up in a position where you have spread the damage among 3 ships, while you have focused on one of their ships to where they had run away, and the other two also.\
\
Finally, for fleet basics, you must understand another concept: Galaxy players, especially good ones, know when to back off or go all in, with the better the player, the sooner they get the hell out of dodge when their odds aren't looking too good. Some players, however, will react differently if the enemy team has a ship that is hulled and of value: they may dive it no matter what, even if it means warping closer to the enemy base. Most galaxy players '''will''' warp out of a fight if they are put onto hull, and this is where communication becomes vital. You need to figure out where the player which you hulled is warping to, what support they will have, and how quick they can despawn their ship or warp to a more advantageous position. Because you will rarely have the firepower to kill a hulled dreadnought before it can dock or warp away, you need friends to warp with you and do as much damage as possible. If you, do it right, and plan accordingly, you will be getting many kills, because fleet combat rarely plays out to where there are multiple casualties, full fleet combat is a way to isolate a target and get a kill.\
=== Fleet Coordination ===\
A fleet is a very desirable thing, for the sheer amount of firepower they can possess and pump out, for the amount of safety they tend to provide against wandering battleships and dreadnoughts, or even for the value and satisfaction of working as a team to complete a goal. However, to get one is difficult at the best of times, and impossible in others, simply due to the fact that you can't get everyone to agree on one given thing, especially if they don't know you. However, there is a way, or a few ways, to get coordination online in any given server.\
#'''Use of in game Communications''' - While the in-game chat service can at certain times best be described as using a light version of Morse code to communicate with a blind man. It does work most of the time, just not always. Under most circumstances, by simply typing in team chat (by doing the command /t and typing normally), you can at least get one determined person to group up with you, and perhaps follow orders.\
#'''Use of External Services''' - This tends to be a more reliable way of communication. Simply hook up the team you are in with a hangout server for, say, Discord, and you suddenly have the speed and efficiency of a mic for use in organization. The only problem is, not many people have Discord, and it is slightly difficult to set up.\
#'''Use of Groups Centered Around Galaxy''' - This is the absolute best way to get a fleet going. Simply join a Discord group, get a few people online, join a server and a mic channel, and have fun. Usually, other members of a group will treat each other well and follow good advice, just be prepared for the occasional misconception.\
Next, there are a few things you must consider while in a fleet and while commanding a fleet:\
# You must have a fallback plan. Have somewhere everyone knows where to warp to when crap inevitably hits the fan.\
# Warp at roughly the same time, and in the same place. Use the distances specified in the warp menu rather than the exact one if it will mean the whole fleet warps in on target.\
# Specify the most dangerous threat on another team and get people to target them. If you want to bring this to another level, have shield breaker ships (ships which are mainly anti-shield) target shielded ships while you have hull breaker ships (ships which counter hull) target and dive hulled enemies.\
# Have a balanced fleet. Be sure to have shield breaking capabilities as well as hull breaking capabilities, with a healthy mix of ships which can dive.\
If you keep your caravan of high-grade weapon transported in working order as specified, you will have a fun time. Try and be polite to one another while in fleet combat, curtsy is usually the best way to get an idea up and fast in a fast-paced situation. Any idea is usually better than inactivity.\
=== Advanced Tactics ===\
====Fighter Swarming====\
Fighter swarming is a method to attack bases, destroy ships or carry out dogfights due to the extremely high firepower all combined fighters of a [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] or a Starbase usually has. This can be done with AI Fighters, though it is of much greater efficacy if it is controlled by players instead.\
==== Crossteaming (clan trapping) ====\
Sometimes, when you have enough connections and firepower, you may crossteam with another powerful player to score a high value kill. This is commonly known as Clan Trapping. Pretend that you and your friend are at war with each other by pretending to be fighting with a shiny Super Capital or two. You may choose to be stationary around one spot or enact a scene of warp chasing, making your target fall for your trick. Once your true target falls for the bait and warp to the scene, both you and your friend should turn on them immediately and get that high valued kill. It is recommended that you only clan trap with very high firepower Dreadnoughts (Retro Prototype X-1, Obliterator and etc.) or Super Capitals, or even Prototypes. This trick is fantastic for targeting someone and most people that had never experienced this will likely fall for this easily.\
==== Ghost team (Logoff trapping) ====\
Have a friend or two stay at your team for a while until they get at least 7% Loyalty. Have them leave the server. Declare war on your target's faction while being solo. Your target might get complacent and not shy away from going after you. Go somewhere and let yourself get attacked by your target, pretend to be low and warp back to your base and let yourself get dived. Have your friends join back at that exact moment and spawn their big ships, because loyalty persists as long as its the same team even though you've left the server. And then annihilate your target.\
==== Multiboxing ====\
Multi-boxing or multiboxing refers to playing as multiple separate accounts/players concurrently in a game. These separate accounts are often called alt (alternate) accounts, or just alts\
\
It is advised to not attempt to multi-box on lower-end devices, as it may result in your device crashing \
=====Applications of Multi-boxing=====\
* People may enjoy making whole swarms of ships by themselves.\
* Makes farming easier.\
* It allows the multi-boxer to have a source of backup as and when they require.\
* Can spy other team chats.\
* Can be especially effective in sieging.\
'''Advantages'''\
* It is easier to grind on different accounts if you're multi-boxing as compared to logging on to each individual account and grinding.\
* It provides a source of backup for the multi-boxer, especially if the multi-boxer's alts have [[:Category:Battleship|battleships]] or even [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreadnoughts]].\
* Allows efficient kills as a multi boxer knows where and when to warp all ships rather than relying on people who may either not warp at the same time or have bad warping.\
* It allows the multi-boxer to make full use of a carrier's fighters, assuming that the multi-boxer does not have AI fighters, especially carriers with low number of fighters ([[Vanguard]], [[Executioner]], [[Prometheus]] etc.)\
* It allows the multi-boxer to have spies in other factions' chats, and give them an upper hand in combat.\
* It allows the multi-boxer to trigger boss spawns.\
'''Disadvantages'''\
* Players may be unable to multi-box efficiently on lower-end devices, as the clients may lag excessively or even crash.\
* Multi-boxing is not a feature supported by Roblox, Apple, Microsoft or any other large tech company. As such, wannabe multi-boxers must be sure that they install the correct multi-boxing software and not a Trojan disguised as one.\
* It requires practice to be able to control your alts, especially once you have 3 or more active at once.\
=====Methods for Multi-boxing=====\
There are several methods for multi-boxing, and each one is unique in its own way. Some methods may be viable for certain players, whereas it may not be for others.\
\
'''Using Multiple Devices to Multi-box'''\
\
Using more than one computer is always an option, especially for individuals with an old computer lying around, which may not have anything better to be doing then rusting in a closet. While this may be a luxury for most players, some have the extra laptops sitting around to do this, and it is probably the simplest of the three to get working. Simply have another Roblox account, download Roblox for that computer, and start playing on both computers at once. This has the disadvantages of requiring multiple computers being already in your possession, and that it may be more difficult to cycle through both computers as they run. However, people with several weaker computers can execute this well enough if they can't do the below strategies, and it works well enough for what it is.\
\
'''Using the Microsoft Version to Multi-box'''\
\
Players using Windows have a way of having two Roblox games open at the same time, with little fuss. As part of Microsoft's push to become a gaming hub, they offer Roblox as an application on their store, which uses different software from the Roblox you may normally download online. Because of this, having both installed means you can play both the web version, and the Microsoft Store version on the same computer. This means you now have two Roblox applications open. This can be combined with with multi-computer multi-boxing if you do not wish to bother with the third type of multi-boxing. '''To be clear, this option is only functional if you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11.'''\
\
'''Using Third-party Software'''\
\
This is the most common, and riskiest, method of multi-boxing. Third party multi-boxing allows you to open as many instances as your computer can handle. Many third-party applications are rather sketchy and flagged by antivirus software. It is recommended for players who do decide to use this path to ask around with more experienced players to learn which are safe and which aren't. Some third-party applications may also be Trojan-ware disguised as multi-boxing software.\
\
The following are a few tools for multi-boxing on Roblox. '''Please note that these (exception of #3) are not created by or officially endorsed by Galaxypedia Staff.'''\
* [https://wearedevs.net/d/Multiple%20Games WeAreDevs Multiple Games] '''This page has advertisements which are likely to link to malware. Make sure to click the correct download button.'''\
* [https://github.com/ic3w0lf22/Roblox-Account-Manager Roblox Account Manager] allows you to manage accounts and prevents old Roblox instances from closing when launching new ones.\
* [https://github.com/Wingysam/RobloxHandleCloser RobloxHandleCloser] is created by Galaxypedia Head Staff member yname. It is safe to use but is complicated to set up.\
* [https://github.com/Asmoww/MultiClient Asmoww MultiClient]\
'''Force Quitting on MacOS'''\
\
This technique is a bit harder to implement due to Apple devices having poor gaming specs but if your Macbook is powerful enough, you could pull this off. This would involve opening an instance of Roblox and then navigating to the apple icon on the top toolbar. Once you have selected the icon, a force quit option will appear. Once that is open, you will force quit Roblox then run it again. An error message will appear but you can close the game. Re-open the game and then you can log off your main account and log on to as many alt accounts you need. The main advantage for this bug is that you do not need to rely on third-party software, and can open multiple instances of the game on different accounts.\
===== Tips for Multi-boxing =====\
* Learn to Alt + Tab. It is considerably faster to alt tab between your alts than it is to select them from the toolbar menu.\
* Use a macro to switch between tabs, as it is faster than Alt + Tab. The most popular macro for this, written in AutoHotKey, is available [https://gist.github.com/Wingysam/3c9c12998b5a34c192e94905f092f616 here]. Once you use this, you will need [https://gist.github.com/Wingysam/30c74b616fcf636fc8dbfd4766a75446 another macro] to use turrets.\
'''Performance'''\
* Close any tabs that are unnecessary to save on RAM and processing power\
* Turn down the graphics for each account to reduce the amount of processing power needed\
* Use [https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker rbxfpsunlocker] to limit your frame rate to 30. This will drastically reduce the processing power required to run the instances of Roblox. '''This is not created by or officially endorsed by Galaxypedia staff, but is generally known to be safe.''' \"At the engineering panel on day 1 of RDC 2019, Adam Miller, VP of Engineering & Technology at Roblox, made a personal guarantee that anyone using Roblox FPS Unlocker will not be banned from Roblox.\" [[https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker#disclaimer source]]\
== Sieges ==\
=== Sieging an Enemy Starbase ===\
These strategies detail how to destroy an enemy [[Starbase]].\
\
To find out what ships will be the most useful in your situation look at their Shapes, DPS, Health, Turret Placement, Alpha Damage, and Speed to see if it will help with your situation.\
==== Classic Siege ====\
The most common method of destroying an enemy [[Starbase]].\
\
Uses a lot of Battleships, Battlecruisers, Cruisers, and Dreadnoughts. Heavier ships with [[Turrets|Railguns]] and [[Turrets|Heavy Lasers]] attack the Starbase and any heavy ships that retaliate, smaller, lighter ships provide evasive cover and make sure nothing gets close to the heavier ships. The main idea of this type of siege is to brute-force their way into destroying the enemy Starbase.\
==== Torpedo Siege ====\
Uses a ship or two with extremely powerful [[Spinals]] and strong long-range capabilities, such as the [[Hasatan]], [[Avalon]] [[Ridgebreaker]] or the [[Hyperion]], along with multiple other Dreadnoughts or Battleships that are capable of tanking and long-range attack, and at least one large ship optimized for PvP such as the [[Hawklight]]. This is an extremely effective siege strategy but it requires some timing and can fail miserably if messed up bad enough. This siege strategy goes for dealing massive damage at a long range, then finishing it off by pushing forward and focus-firing on the Starbase. Once the Starbase's shields are depleted, it deals significant hull damage.\
==== Outside the Box ====\
(This strategy works only for enemy [[Starbase]]s close to the edge of the map).\
\
This strategy uses any ship with extremely high range (7k+). Ships like the [[Hasatan]], [[Avalon]], or [[Andromeda]] are best. Said ship needs to nearly go outside of the map. The ship needs to go as far up as possible without taking boundary damage, this helps with hiding from the enemy. The [[Hasatan]] then shoots as many Torpedoes as possible before getting spotted and running away. If the ship does not destroy the enemy Starbase before being caught, a \"Classic Seige\" or a \"Torpedo Siege\" can easily finish off the job. This strategy is very effective if done right and can cripple and destroy even the strongest of enemy bases, the only downside being you need a specific circumstance and it's surprisingly hard to hit your target.\
\
(Addendum: with the addition of the new warp mechanics, ships are no longer able to warp while outside the map. This places a great deal of risk on operating the Outside The Box strategy.)\
\
(Another Note: As of a recent update, the map was greatly expanded and it's now even less likely for a starbase to spawn within 7k distance of a boundary, further limiting the possibilities of the Outside the Box Strategy).\
==== Fighter Siege ====\
First, park any [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] outside the base range (9k-11k) alongside a sieging fleet. Use the [[:Category:Fighters|Fighters]] to distract base fire so your ships can stay within range and fire upon the Starbase. Make sure at least 3 guys are manning the fighters, and at least 2 [[:Category:Battleship|Battleships]]. In order to do this correctly have 1-2 people in [[Sixfold]]s or [[Cobra]]s to shoot down enemy fighters or ships. If you do this correctly, none of the ships in your fleet except for the Fighters will get damaged.\
==== Flash Fleet ====\
A tactic used to catch the enemy by surprise. (The enemy Starbase has to be somewhat close to the edge of the map).\
\
This strategy is very similar to \"Outside the Box\" except instead of just a [[Hasatan]] there is a fleet, imagine a \"Classic Seige\" or a \"Torpedo Siege\" except off radar. How this strategy works is by having ships sneak out of the map (doesn't allow the radar to see you). A [[:Category:Carrier|Carrier]] would be good for this because it's just a single ship, but it can deploy a fleet. It can be suspicious if multiple ships go out of the map at the same time. Because of this, each ship will have to go out of the map every minute or so as to avoid detection. From there you can launch the attack, catch them all off guard, and destroy their Starbase.\
==== Drop Firing ====\
This tactic should be used along with the strategies for sieging. Doing this alone will result in low damage being done and a few dead ships if you're not careful.\
\
Use small ships that have a lot of [[Spinals]]. Lowest amount is four small phasers or cannons. Ships such as the [[Viper]] are alright for damaging shields. [[Sixfold]] is good for hull destruction. [[Razor Wing]] Is also a good all-rounder since it has both [[Spinals|Cannons]] and [[Spinals|Phasers]]. Repeatedly do flybys of the base, damaging it each time. You can also bring in some [[Phantom|Phantom's]] to help kill shield because of the lasers on the bottom. Again, do NOT attempt to use this strategy alone. This is a strategy that is to be used with another.\
==== Alien Supporters ====\
This strategy is generally unreliable, but it could be useful. You need a [[Aliens|Punisher]] and group of [[Aliens|Swarmers]] for this to work. First, the Aliens need to attack the enemy Starbase. This step is challenging because it's hard to lead Aliens to a specific place. Once the Aliens are at the enemy's Starbase, the Aliens will attack whatever the [[Aliens|Punisher]] does, causing trouble for any players the Punisher's AI might target. After the Aliens have either retreated or died, the Starbase will most likely be low on health, or dead entirely. This strategy is generally one that isn't used since the Punisher might target one of your sieging ships, causing critical damage. If this strategy is used, its best to wait for all the Aliens to die, otherwise you are putting yourself in a risky position.\
==== Nuking ====\
Take any large ship like an M-class, Dreadnoughts, etc. and drive it straight at the enemy base. Get as close as you can to the base and let it destroy you. When your ship explodes, the explosion might take the enemy base down with you and will damage any nearby ships. Some good ships for nuking are Nyx, Galaxy, etc. However, using these ships are not recommended unless you are in arcade, since these ships are also generally immensely expensive in the regular version of the game.\
==== Long-Range Siege ====\
Take any ship that has a turret with a high range and a lot of damage like an [[Xenon]], [[Lazarus]], [[Andromeda]], Super Capital Ships, etc. and drive it 8000–6000 studs away from the enemy base, then attack the base.\
=== Defense Against Sieges ===\
These strategies are used for defending against an enemy or countering some of the siege tactics listed above.\
==== Fleet in Being ====\
This tactic is aimed at showing off military power while not leaving the base.  Players will spawn in large [[Ships]] or combat vessels as to show off military power and make itself a threat while not actually engaging in combat unless absolutely forced to. These ships will simply be docked at either their own Starbase or at the [[Mega Base]]. Docking enough of these Ships at your own starbase might influence enemy decisions and can prevent sieges. This will also help prevent [[Pirating]] if done at [[Mega Base]].\
==== Dock Camping ====\
This strategy is highly effective when used in a situation where the enemy team has a clear advantage and you and your team are not willing to lose any ships but still want to defend your team. Your team will pick your most heavily armed base (Often the [[Mothership]] or a high-level planet) but a [[Starbase|Level 4 Starbase]] can work depending on your enemies strength) and dock your ships there. But can be used to defend any base just be ready to despawn if your ship's health runs too low. If it gets too damaged go to the strongest base and see if it is safe to spawn it and heal there but despawn it if enemies come by unless it is healed enough.\
\
Keep your team's best and strongest ships docked at your best base using it as a mega stronghold. The combination of your best bases turrets and your best ships docked at the base is sure to cause trouble for the attackers. Keeping your ships docked or very close is crucial, the point is to despawn your ship when it is too low (not risking losing your ship). '''IT IS VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO BE LURED OUT OF YOUR BASE RANGE BY AN ENEMY SHIP. THIS IS OFTEN A TRAP.'''\
\
This strategy can often take a lot of time. You need to wait for your enemy to decide to attack you which may not happen for 1–2 hours or more (any intelligent team will clearly see the difficulty and risk). When they do attack, it is very important that your team '''coordinates which ship to destroy and attack the same ship''', this is important because you want to destroy the ship fast or it will just warp away and heal up. You and your team want to slowly take out the fire from a fleet by targeting the big ships one by one. If a ship gets away '''NEVER CHASE.'''\
\
This strategy requires a loyal team willing to be very patient, and a number of ships/players similar to your enemies. This is commonly used and learned by players on their own but was added by Hamlet9219.\
==== What to Shoot ====\
This tactic is a very uncommon one. This requires a decent-sized team that has members willing to co-operate. You need a [[Starbase|Level-3 Starbase]] or a Carrier to apply this.\
\
First, when you realize that a siege will occur, tell all your team members to get in a [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] that spawns on the base's hangar or in the carrier. And you yourself get your most powerful PvP ship. The speed of it doesn't matter much. When you have a PvP ship and a squadron of fighters. When the enemy ships come, it will be hard for them to choose which one to attack. Fighters? The PvP? Or the starbase?\
\
If they attack Fighters, the PvP ship and the base lasers will take them down slowly while the ships that are good for sieges, which have inaccurate turrets will be taking more than five minutes to destroy the small Fighters.\
\
They attack the PvP ship, then the small but many Fighters will kill at least two of the siegers and the base will take the other.\
\
If the siegers attack the base, you will get the worst result out of all three options of theirs. But still, you won't get the base destroyed if you didn't make a critical mistake. Continuing on, If they attack the starbase, the PvP ship will destroy the first sieger in less than 45 seconds. While the fighters have finished the other one, all of you destroy the last one together and get your bounties.\
\
Another chance is that the reinforcements will arrive for the enemy team. Even if it happens, which is unlikely for their team members have seen what happened to the most powerful ones. The ships they will bring probably will be weak, So it's unlikely they will even get a chance to shoot at the base among the crowd of the small ships.\
==== Defensive Swarm ====\
Swarm involves everyone on the team using a ship that is fast and can deal a lot of damage, preferably a ship like the [[Sixfold]], or another Cruiser. All of the ships then will target one ship at a time, either scaring it off and forcing it to warp, or destroying it. It's typically good to make sure your team is out of the ships' lines of sight, or the Starbase is being shot at by them.\
\
By doing this, you can either delay a siege or completely stop one. However, some drawbacks are your team won't want to coordinate or doesn't want to risk their small ships for defense.\
==== Ambush ====\
While having a few tanky capital ships defending the base from the attacks head-on, other players can teleport to different bases like the [[Mega Base]] or any other capped starbase (if any) and spawn ships from there.\
\
If capital ships are available, hard-hitting ones will be a better choice than tankier ones due to the enemy targeting the defending fleet and the base these ships could be [[Avalon]], [[Nemesis]], [[Tempest]], [[Jackal]] and any hull breaker due to the starbases shield focus weaponry.\
\
If Capital ships aren't available, then spawn a fleet of non-capital but hard hitting ships, this includes [[Razor Wing]], [[Belvat]], [[Vansnova]], [[Absolution]], [[Dramiel]], [[Arthur]] and [[Sentinel]].\
==== Peekaboo ====\
A minimum of two bases (at least one being level 2) is required for this, preferably the [[Mothership]] and main starbase. Have one player go to the main starbase and spawn a cruiser/battlecruiser. The rest of the team will remain at the other base and WILL NOT spawn any ships. At this point, it is likely that the enemies will siege the main starbase because of its strategic importance and the opportunity for a kill. When the siege has begun, the team at the other base will spawn multiple battleships and a dreadnought if possible. Then this team will warp to the main starbase. This should happen very quickly, preferably in the timespan of 30 seconds. The siege team will be unprepared and will be destroyed easily. This strategy is largely based on chance, so it should only be used as a last resort.\
==== Revenge from the Grave ====\
Allow the enemy to siege your base with little resistance, and then pull off a heavily guarded 'Classic Siege' or 'Torpedo Siege' on theirs from another base. The enemies will retreat and attempt to destroy your fleet. Warp away as soon as the enemy warps near you. If they siege again, they will likely split their forces, leaving some ships at their base. Their forces are now stretched thin. Spawn a massive fleet at an obsolete level 2 base that is not being attacked, let's call this fleet A, and destroy the defending force on their side. Wait for the enemy siege team to return to the base and destroy them too. Siege their base with fleet A and now that you do not have to defend yourself anymore, you can spare more ships.\
==== Logoff Trap: Siege Edition ====\
Do the same thing, have yourself and a friend or two stay at a team and get at least 7% Loyalty. Declare war against the biggest teams on the server and then leave the server. Put a low score alt onto the team to watch how everything goes. When the teams siege your base, join the server with your friends then spawn all your shiny powerful ships and take your enemies by surprise. This is best done with Super Capitals and have your friends on separate teams so that multiple Super Capitals may be used to achieve maximum damage. Target the most valuable ship to get the most out of this, as the server is likely never going to fall for this again for the next 3 or 4 hours.\
==Money Making==\
Galaxy has many ways to make money, each with advantages and disadvantages. Knowing when and how to work for credits will greatly help you progress in Galaxy. Each tab details a specific strategy for making money. \
===Mining===\
Mining is slower than trading, but also much safer (assuming that you mine around your own base). Miners fuel the economy and help to keep it alive. Because miners are not armed well; they can be a big target; so it's best to keep your miner around your own base - this also helps reduce travel time. More info can be found in the page [[Mining]].\
\
'''Advantages'''\
*The payment is consistent and doesn't rely on the economy being good.\
*Ores can often be found very close to the base, especially in newer factions, meaning mining is fairly risk-free.\
*The ores generated through mining can be sold for considerably more than the base paid for them, meaning if you then sell them to another faction (or the Mega Base), you can make a lot of money for your faction - this is the primary source of income for most factions, and the main way of getting a strong faction started.\
*Mining is the best way to accumulate lots of a specific ore inside a starbase to lower the price of that ore for trading.\
*Is a great way to get some quick cash if you ever need a boost. \
'''Disadvantages'''\
*Ores can sometimes be very far from the base, especially in older factions, or if you're exclusively mining a single ore in order to try to lower its price.\
*When mining far from the base, it can sometimes not be possible to get back to your base within the 90 second grace period before a war begins.\
*Miners will have a harder time dealing with enemies such as aliens, as they have little firepower to deal with them.\
*Pirates may declare war on you wanting to destroy your miner.\
*Uranium is rather rare or nonexistent in some public servers, so it cannot be consistently mined.\
*Bases can't have negative credits anymore, so you need to wait for your base to gain enough credits before you can sell your ore. Until then it is better to transfer your ore into your warehouse.\
*!!! Ores no longer spawn if there are only 2 teams left on the server during endgame.\
[[File:Mining_photo.png|680x680px]]\
===Combat Rewards===\
Combat Rewards is a way of making money by damaging and destroying ships.\
'''Tips and Tricks'''\
* '''This is the most dangerous way to make money and is NOT recommended for newer players'''\
* If you are new and want to dip your toes into making money through combat rewards, starting off with killing alien swarmers and alien bruisers is a good way to learn basic combat, just be sure not to lose your ship!\
* Be in a team with a sizable fleet, that way you and your teammates can take down large ships with much more ease. Teamwork is key.\
* If sieging, stay close to your team's fleet or the enemy may target you for being alone.\
* Follow your fleet commander's orders, if he's telling you to retreat, you should probably retreat.\
* Don't take on larger ships by yourself unless you are in a ship of the same class. Even then, check the minimap frequently in case there are other sneaky teammates waiting to strike you when you're low.\
* War is much more common in larger servers\
* Joining war servers that are in endgame will boost the rate you gain loyalty by 1.5x, so it's better to join those kinds of servers for some kills.\
'''Advantages'''\
* Gets you more familiarized with the game's unique ships and current meta.\
* Teaches you how to properly fight against another player, which is amazing knowledge to have in this game.\
* Unlike mining or trading, combat rewards aren't grindy and are a fun way to make credits.\
* Being in lots of fleets will teach you which players to avoid.\
*Can be a great complement to what loot enemies may have, especially for bosses such as the Kodiak, which can reward up to 200k Credits in rewards.\
'''Disadvantages'''\
* If not experienced enough, you might lose large amounts of credits through ship destruction.\
* Requires lots of skill and knowledge in the game.\
* Players may hold a grudge towards you and target you if you were responsible for killing one of their valued ships.\
* A lot of players will run away once they're hulled, making you miss out on potential combat rewards.\
*If your ship is destroyed, the potential rewards will not carry over.\
* Loyalty takes time to gain.\
===Vulturing===\
Vulturing is a way of gaining money by looting the remains of NPC or Player wrecks without contributing.\
This playstyle is normally utilized during events to which the value of NPC wrecks are high.\
\
\
===Pirating===\
[[Pirating]] is a more dangerous way of making money, involving the destruction (and looting) of freighters and miners for money, and occasionally including claiming the bounty if the target had one. Pirates usually use small fast ships that can kill miners and freighters quickly without taking heavy damage from the base lasers. Common ships for pirating include the [[Cobra]], [[Sixfold]] and [[Gideon]], and wealthy pirates may use [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ships]] for some tasks. Pirates normally attack miners and freighters due to the fact that these ships are unarmed and are expensive, with freighters usually carrying a lot of additional loot in their cargo hold. Most pirates have a decent-sized bounty, making them fairly easy to spot.\
\
Late game pirates who are more wealthy and familiar with the game often pick up common behaviors from certain players. Using all of this to their advantage they are able to pick out armed capital ships to pirate to gain even more wealth from the large wrecks Dreadnoughts and Carriers can leave behind. These pirates also can lay out a trap and specifically target something they lay eyes on to secure their goal and profit from it with the least casualty.\
\
Many recommended ships for Pirating can be found in the page [[:Category:Pirate Ship|Pirate Ships.]]\
\
'''Tips and Tricks'''\
*Ships as big as carriers and dreadnoughts can be targeted by pirates if the pirates are in a group, or if the dreadnoughts have just left a large battle, such as a base siege.\
*Occasionally it can be profitable to lose a ship whilst pirating if you manage to kill your target, especially when the target has a bounty. (Using your own ship explosion can be a last resort in finishing off a low target)\
*As miners and freighters are often big and slow, spinal-based ships like the [[Cobra]] are good at killing them.\
*Cruisers like the [[Nidhogg]] can slowly use its spinals to pick off the miner or freighter's shields and use its flak cannons to easily finish off the ship.\
*Taking the time to familiarize yourself with the common behaviors of certain players and new players can allow you to create better decisions and predict what you can do.\
*Stealth ships can be excellent for this purpose, as they can sneak up on unsuspecting players, but be aware that due to their low durability that chasing a fleeing target may not be possible.\
'''Advantages'''\
* Pirating can be fairly easy, especially when targeting miners far from their base.\
* The enemy ships are normally unarmed.\
* Pirating can bring in a lot of money very fast if it goes well.\
* Pirating is fairly cheap to start, as strong pirate ships are very cheap in comparison to miners and freighters (such as the Cobra or Gideon).\
* When using a small ship with warp, it is usually easy to escape if a large ship comes along, making it fairly risk-free if you're careful.\
* If you want to gain a high bounty, pirating is a great way to increase it, as most of your targets will not have a bounty of their own.\
'''Disadvantages'''\
* Pirates can sometimes be easy to spot due to decent bounty, losing you the element of surprise.\
* Pirating requires a lot of patience.\
* Players may remember you and may announce the fact that you're a pirate to others.\
* Many players will look down on pirates with distaste.\
* Some players may hold a grudge and want revenge.\
* If failed miserably, you can lose large amounts of money from ship destruction.\
* Many players escape to their starbase as soon as a war is declared, making it difficult to get to them.\
* It can be difficult to hurt other players while they are warping away.\
* It takes a while to gain enough loyalty.\
===Private Server Methods===\
Owning or having an access to a private server is the key to some of the best money making methods in the entire game. Millions of credits can be made in a single day if done properly.\
==== Boss Hunting ====\
Sit in a private server until a boss spawns, then kill and loot it.\
\
'''Advantages'''\
* You can be afk for most of the time.\
* Very easy to do if you have the sufficient firepower.\
* Nobody to fight against for the loot.\
* Completely risk free if you're alone, since you can shutdown the server or leave to despawn your ship immediately when you're about to die.\
'''Disadvantages'''\
* One of the least efficient ways of using a private server to farm credits.\
* Not doable if you don't have the sufficient firepower.\
* Can be dangerous if you're fighting against a Kodiak or Decimator and you're not alone.\
* Takes quite a bit of time investment, as bosses don't spawn frequently.\
*Combat reward diminishes by quite a lot if you require the help of a base.\
===Buying Credits===\
Buying credits is the easiest and fastest way to make money in-game. Nothing rivals how much money can be gained in a single click. Hundreds of thousands of credits can be made in just seconds.\
\
'''Advantages'''\
*The fastest and easiest way to make money in-game.\
*You can be anywhere in-game and still be able to buy credits.\
'''Disadvantages'''\
*The price for credits costs an exorbitant amount of Robux.\
===Patched Unintended Money Making Methods===\
====<s>Battery Duping</s>====\
<s>Battery Duping Involves selling something to [[Mega Base]], often in Private Server then as soon as the servers all update and it shows up outside of your server, you have alts buy it on seperate servers, and if you're quick enough, the game sells you more materials than it actually has in stock. This can cause materials' stock to be in the negatives sometimes.</s>\
==== <s>Shutdown Mining</s> ====\
<s>Enter a private server, make a team, mine a full ore hold, then shutdown the server. You'll get around 50% more credits than the normal amount from automatic refund, and nobody knows why. But hey, its free money!</s>\

Dread /carrier Changes\
\
'''[[Avalon]] Buff'''\
-- Shield 4,250 -> 4,750\
-- 3x Medium Torpedo -> 3x Large Torpedo\
\
'''[[Catalyst]] Buff'''\
-- 1x Heavy LR Laser -> Triple Heavy Laser\
-- 1x Medium Railgun -> Dual Heavy Railgun\
-- Shield 7,000 -> 6,520\
\
'''[[Executioner]] Buff'''\
-- Hunter 2 Medium Cannon -> 5, interval 0.2 -> 0.15\
\
'''[[Retribution]] Buff'''\
-- 4 Small Torpedo -> 3/2 Large Cannon\
\
'''[[Warlock]] Buff'''\
-- Looses 2 Medium Lasers\
-- 2 Medium Lasers switched to 2 Dual Medium Lasers\
-- 1 Large cannon -> 2 Large cannons\
\
-- [[Obamasphere|obamasphere]] returns.\
\
-- [[Ibis]] remodeled by Duck_Blox\
[[File:Ibis-update-log.png|thumb|Ibis remodel]]\
\
'''[[Frostpocalypse]]''' balanced by @GodrevyD approved by @Octavion\
\
-- Nose is now a [[Spinal Weaponry|Huge Torpedo]]\
-- [[Turrets]] overhauled, [[Frostpocalypse]] is now alpha-based\
\
With these changes, [[Frostpocalypse]] should be relevant in the meta and useful to people who have it. There are no plans to make it obtainable by LBM as it is considered a trophy ship.\
\
'''[[3D Printed Warlock]]''' balanced by @GodrevyD, approved by Shadiris\
\
''[[Turrets|Medium 3D Printed Railgun]]''\
-- Reload 9.6 -> 10\
-- Damage 288 -> 240\
\
''[[Turrets|Medium 3D Printed Laser]]''\
-- Reload 5.12 -> 6.4\
-- Range 5866 -> 7000\
-- Damage 120 -> 200\
\
Average DPS 283 -> 356\
\
-- [[Plasma Battery]] blackmarket has been removed for now. Planning to add it back after [[Rcouret|rc]] patches duping.\
\
-- Re-enabled, fixed the duping\
\
-- [[Plasma Battery|Plasma Batteries]] and [[Armor Scrap|Armor Scraps]] now have 0.1 mass and cannot be sold.\
\
All balanced by @GodrevyD, approved by shipmasters\
\
```[[Crystocrene]]```\
DPS has been reduced to keep the ship more in-line with our desired balance. Accuracy and range will be better now.\
-- 2x [[Turrets|Triple Heavy Quantum Laser]] -> 2x [[Turrets|Heavy Quantum Laser]]\
\
Average DPS 375 -> 358\
\
```[[Imperator]]```\
DPS has been somewhat increased. We think this will be enough to make the ship relevant without making [[Helios]] and other battleships irrelevant.\
-- 4 Large Cannon -> 2/2 Large Cannon (both still bound to F)\
-- Gains 1 Medium Cannon ([[Turrets|turret]], not [[Spinal Weaponry|spinal]])\
-- 2x Triple Heavy Laser -> 2x Heavy Quantum Laser\
\
Average DPS 264 -> 298\
\
```[[Retro Aegis]]```\
Retro Aegis was previously the worst limited battleship in Galaxy. It should now be relevant for breaking shields as it was meant to be. You will still need hullbreakers to supplement its extremely low hull DPS.\
-- +1 [[Turrets|Retro Heavy Laser]]\
-- +1 [[Turrets|Retro Small Laser]]\
\
Shield DPS 293 -> 362\
\
```[[Retro Hawklight]]```\
Retro Hawklight was stronger than we wanted it to be, so its DPS has been slightly reduced.\
-- [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Cannon]] interval 0.009 -> 0.2\
\
Average DPS 336 -> 317\
\
```[[Grim]]```\
[[Retro Hawklight]] and Grim have effectively swapped, as it should have always been. Grim is not planned to be obtainable again and veteran players should be rewarded for sticking with the game for these years.\
-- +2 [[Spinal Weaponry|Large Cannon]]\
\
Average DPS 316 -> 340\
\
-- [[Prototype X-1]] custom collision boxes\
\
-- [[Subjugator]] joins the rest of the supers in being unobtainable until SC Permit 2.9m\
\
-- Fixed Kneall Exterminator error\
\
-- [[Kodiak]] and [[X-0]] now only spawn in public servers\
\
```[[Lucifer]] Range Nerf``` by @GodrevyD, approved by shipmasters\
-- Lucifer Cannon renamed to [[Turrets|Lucifer's Cannon]], range 7000 -> 6500\
-- [[Turrets|Lucifer's Blade]] range 7000 -> 6500\
\
-- [[2022 Ship (soup gon edition)|2022 ship (soup gon edition)]] has been brought back! i hope y'all didnt sell it from your inventories cause those who still own it should have it now\
\
-- [[Subjugator]] shield glowup\
\
-- [[Dragoon|Dragoons]] and [[Jormungand|Jormungands]] no longer spawn at [[Mega Base]]. -- [[Kodiak]] spawns in private servers again. -- [[Decimator]] now spawns at Mega Base.\

'''Halloween Event, Part 1, has arrived! (finally)'''\
\
--New NPCs replace both the [[Pirates]] and the [[Kneall]], they're quite scary!\
\
--[[Mega Base]] has been.. plagued!? Take a good look around!\
\
--4 new Event [[Ships]] have appeared on the [[Build Menu|build menu]], expect more on the way\
\
--Stage One of the Evolution has begun.\
\
--Enjoy Part One! Part Two will come around in the near future!\
\
--[[:Category:Quest|Quest]] Ship fixed in new servers\
\
--[[Dissonance|Dissonances]] should hopefully spawn more often\

\
--[[Hellkeeper]] minimum player requirement 7 --> 4\
\
--[[Mega Base]] D Terminal has been blocked off, I wonder why?\
\
--[[Mega Base]] begins to tilt\
\
--The Infected grow stronger.\
\
--The Evolution Continues.\
\
--[[:Category:Quest|Quest]] Requirement: 7 Embryos --> 5\
\
--[[Valkerac]] teleporter probably fixed\
\
The long-awaited custom buying amounts are here! Using the new trade menu I designed, you can buy and sell custom amounts from [[Starbase|starbases]]. You might be asking why it’s so big, that’s because I had to make it big so the custom amount textbox doesn’t get truncated (Shows … at the end when it’s too long) How to use: Click in the textbox, put in the amount you want to buy and press enter. If you change your mind and don’t want to buy the custom amount after typing it in, simply click off and it’ll clear it out for you. Hope you guys like this update! Next project: settings menu; will work on making [[warehouse]] show up on the side of the menu\
\
--Halloween Event end date will be delayed by a few days due to Roblox dying (or however long it's down for)\
\
[[:Category:Stealth Ship|STEALTH SHIPS]]? You heard right! As of now there is [[Stealth One|one Stealth Ship]] that has been added to the game in new servers. Stealth ships offer a different angle of gameplay, they're the fastest ships in the game, more agile than even admin ships and pack a punch. However they are VERY weak and cannot take many hits. [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth ships]] DO NOT appear on the map\
\
In order to obtain these [[:Category:Stealth Ship|stealth ships]], they're built like any other through [[Build Menu|build menu]]. You'll just need [[Stealth Plating]]. STEALTH PLATING CANNOT BE OBTAINED AS OF YET, IT WILL SOON BE ADDED\
\
DISCLAIMER: [[:Category:Stealth Ship|STEALTH SHIPS]] ARE HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WHICH INCLUDES NERFS, BUFFS, AND/OR FULL SHIP REPLACEMENT AT ANY TIME WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS/WEEK.\
\
--[[Subjugator]] shields fixed\
\
-Roblox updated some things and code has shifted around. Rc is working on fixing the ship controls and then [[stealth Plating]] will be released to the public. ETA >24 hours\
\
--[[Nimitz]] back on [[Build Menu]]\
\
--[[Valkerac]] TP probably fixed\
\
--[[Nimitz]] offsale again\
\
--[[Valkerac]] no longer has a tp, instead you jump down right into the pilotseat\
\
--[[:Category:Frigate|Frigates]], [[:Category:Destroyer|Destroyers]], and [[:Category:Admin|Admin Ships]] can now spawn at the [[Mega Base]]\
\
--[[:Category:Freighter|Freighters]] can spawn at [[Mega Base]] as well\
\
--[[Stealth Plating]] live in New servers. They can be found in the loot of L4/L5 [[Starbase|Starbases]]. (Will be adding to L5 [[mothership]] as well after Halloween is over) There is a second [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth ship]] added, \"[[Stealth B-2]]\" inspired (NOT a replica of) by the B2 Bomber.\
\
--2 [[Stealth Plating|Stealth plating]] drops added to Level 5 [[Mothership]].\
\
--[[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth Ships]] detectability range ''-->>should<<--'' now be 3x less than the ships in their class. What this means for the current stealth ships in the game classed as [[:Category:Battleship|battleships]]:\
\
* Normal [[:Category:Battleship|battleships]] - 110k\
* [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth]] [[:Category:Battleship|battleships]] - 36k-40k\
\
I understand some of you have concerns about the detectability reduced further (some of you have said 10k would be good), I cannot allow that as it will be too powerful. Remember, we have to factor in a potential fleet of [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth ships]], not just you alone. Hopefully this change will improve the gameplay and Stealth factor in them. The second concern players have brought up are the visible [[Spinal Weaponry|torpedo]]. We tried to make them invisible but you couldn't tell where you were aiming and where did it land. If this is a repetitive concern, I will make the torpedo invisible as well.\

\
NEW [[Turrets|TURRET]] TYPE: Sniper Turrets! They have PERFECT Accuracy & 10k Range. HOWEVER, The beam itself is slower. This means that while the enemy is in range, if they are a fast moving target there is a lower chance at hitting them. This is also dependent on the ship size, the larger the ship size, the higher chances of landing your shot. (This is unique since other turrets have to rely on Accuracy & bullet speed)\
\
NEW [[:Category:Stealth Ship|STEALTH SHIP]]: The [[Stealth Recon]] is currently the only ship to utilize the Sniper Turrets. It is a far more affordable [[:Category:Stealth Ship|Stealth ship]] and requires a lot less [[Stealth Plating|Platings]]. It is currently a [[:Category:Destroyer|destroyer]] class, which means it has MUCH LESS DETECTION RANGE! It provides a very interesting type of gameplay style which I'm excited to see and hear back feedback from you guys. The current model for the [[Stealth Recon]] was created by @Solaris (edited)\
\

(+2 [[Spinal Weaponry|Small torpedo]], HP Buff, +5 Torque) I have also separated the [[Spinal Weaponry|torpedo]] into 2 different volleys, so you'll be able to fire one side of the ship at a time(F+G). The buffs were based off of the feedback I have received. (can be nerfed however). I've attached a picture of the remodel, shown inside a planet atmosphere so you'll be able to actually see it.\

The Dev team has collectively decided that we are going to be removing most of the old, useless reskin models. We understand collecting ships, and the effort and time it took to get them. So you will be eligible for a full refund based on the event cost of the ship at the time you bought it. This will be done via [[:Category:Quest|quests]] and we are currently adding them. We're going to give everyone a grace period to either use or turn in your ship(s) before they get removed.\
\
This will better load times, and make balance less.. dumb.\
\
The following ships will be removed in one month. Please go up the stairs in Terminal D of the [[Mega Base]] and go to the Reskin Refund platform. Once you are here, please complete the [[:Category:Quest|quests]] for each ship you own. If you do not complete the quests before the ships are removed, they will become redboxes in your inventory. Each refund will give you an additional $15k over the original cost.\
\
If you have proof of yourself purchasing a ship with a [[Permits|permit]], then proceeding to turn it in by [[:Category:Quest|quest]], you can submit a refund-request for your credits back! \
*D [[Permits|Permit]] - 400k credits \
*E [[Permits|Permit]] - 100k credits \
No other [[permits]] were used for the ships that are being removed\
\
The ships being removed are as follows:\
*[[Arctic Sparrow]]\
*[[Arctic Wasteland]]\
*[[Cold Blood]]\
*[[Freedom General]]\
*[[Freedom Wolf]]\
*[[Golden Viper]]\
*[[Icebreaker]]\

\
--[[Osiris|Osiris's]] price can now be decreased due to the gap between [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|super caps]] and [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreads]] being widened as well as with the [[:Category:Prototype|prototypes]]. Also lowered the health of the [[Osiris]] due to it receiving a stronger [[Turrets|turret]]. All [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|super caps]] were buffed due to them not performing up to what they should be performing. They are meant to have a bigger impact on the game than what they presently do. I changed the [[Alpha Damage|alpha]] and reload to make it accommodate more towards larger ship pvp and sieging but less effective against smaller ships. Now don't get me wrong if these [[turrets]] hit a small ship that small ship ceases to exist. Also with this update, the [[Slipstream]] has become more unique as a [[:Category:Dreadnought|dread]] due to the loadout changes. So just hop in and see what the changes are. [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]] also got buffed along with the [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|super caps]]. But only due to them not ever going on sale again.\

<strong>Pt 1/2 Capital Rebalance Update V2--<em>Changes will be listed underneath if you don't want to read the wall of text</em></strong>\
\
So in an effort to make the capitalships namely dread+ more competitive all [[:Category:Dreadnought|dread's]] mediums have been swapped out for large [[Turrets|turret]] variants of the same type. This has increased their DPS yes, but also their accuracy has been reduced massively. While also their current large weapons have been swapped out with new turrets being the Capital turrets which are a much stronger variant of the original [[turrets]], while also being much more inaccurate due to buffed stats. But also this update brings all the [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreads]] to have decent ranges now amongst them all. The longer ranged higher [[Alpha Damage|alpha]] capital turrets have 8k range, while the lower alpha higher reload turrets have 7k range. There is also two new [[turrets]] in this update while also removing the rapid fire turrets but being replaced by the new [[Turrets|Heavy Flak Cannons]] and [[Turrets|Heavy PDL]]. Both of these [[turrets]] have replaced the obvious med flaks and PDL's on the [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreads]] that had them. All in all the DPS's of all [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreads]] and [[:Category:Super Capital Ship|super caps]] because their heavies were replaced with the new capital turrets which makes them better against larger ships, but more ineffective against smaller ships. Sure if the shots land they will decimate the smaller ships, but with them being more inaccurate its less likely. In the future this will make it more easier to adjust the stats of individual classes instead of all of them as there is more turrets to be edited. You will be happy to know that the highest price increase on a [[:Category:Dreadnought|dread]] has only been 4k credits.\

<em><strong>[[:Category:Prototype|PROTOTYPE]] REBIRTH!!!!</strong></em>\
[[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]] for awhile have been under performing as to what they are to be. The [[Prototype X-2|X-2]] for one became too powerful for what it was. As such has been rebalanced. The [[Prototype X-1|X-1]] has also been buffed up to be able to match a [[Prototype X-2|X-2]]. Both of the ships have received INSANE remodels, basically remaking the ships. Have received new custom [[turrets]] to help clear out the amount of assets that we have for turrets which were taking up unnecessary space. 3 New [[:Category:Quest|quests]] have came with this update. 2 Being for the [[:Category:Prototype|Prototypes]] so I guess they don't really count. Also did I mention if you have lost them before you are able to rebuy them this time round? And that this is the last time that prototypes will release? Anyways 1 of the quests that came with this will be important for later updates as well. But the [[:Category:Quest|quest]] is required for the [[:Category:Prototype|prototypes]]. This quest is located where the harbourmaster is. The quest givers for the Protos have been hidden away in a hidden place. Only hint I shall give is get upgrading.\

--2 New Memes In The [[Mega Base]].\
\
--[[Kodiak]] has been renamed and recieved a slight buff. It will be released for about a week during april fools\
\
'''--<em>[[Prototype X-3]] Released! </em>'''You heard that right. Here is the [[prototype X-3]]. It's available for 7 Mil credits, a Weapon part and a Alien device. Y'all just got to find the person who sells it which i've hidden VERY well. Good luck finding it. Here's a teaser of what it looks like. [//gyazo.com/0de1f6f26f3515d65c2841691f94a770 https://gyazo.com/0de1f6f26f3515d65c2841691f94a770]\
\
--Cost command for [[Prototype X-3|X-3]] fixed\
\
--I'ma add this tidbit btw since I revealed more. It will be available for two weeks. If you can find it within that time that is. So either decide to look for it or to grind for it. Your choice.\
\
--[[Kodiak]] can now spawn in servers\
\
--New Base Assimilation Sound: [//www.roblox.com/library/3037899599/Base-Assimilation-Xentheta https://www.roblox.com/library/3037899599/Base-Assimilation-Xentheta] replaces [//www.roblox.com/library/2037232298/Binkovs-Battlegrounds-Music-Base-Assimilation-Cut https://www.roblox.com/library/2037232298/Binkovs-Battlegrounds-Music-Base-Assimilation-Cut] (Old)\
\
--P.S I know some of the new sounds get cut off but that is because of the way [[Rcouret|rc]] has it scripted, since the older sounds were music he scripted them to cut off at a certain time so not much I can do about it till he is back. (Sean)\
\
<em><strong>[[Artifacts|ARTIFACT]] SHIPS RETURN </strong></em>So i've brought back the artifact ships through a [[:Category:Quest|quest]] system. They will be found in a new room which has replaced an old room in the [[Mega Base]]. As a precaution they all are now rather expensive <em>Sorry</em> but they have returned as such for now. The larger ships are much more expensive such as the [[Galaxy]] or [[Osiris]]. Let me know if anything is still unanchored from testing lol.\
\
--Only Available in public servers\
\
--Potential [[Imperator]] buff incoming\
\
Also, let's just rename [[Artifacts|Artifact]] ships to [[:Category:Advanced Ship|Advanced ships]] for now since they don't really require artifacts\
\
--[[Prototype X-3|X-3]] Public server requirement removed, date pushed back by another week till X-3 removed\
\
--[[Imperator]] [[:Category:Quest|Quest]] price label fixed. It is indeed 1m. If it says 400k it is still 1m.\
\
--Some Minor Details To The [[Mega Base]] & Louder [[Turrets|Mining Laser]] Sound.\
\
--[[Kodiak]] [[turrets]] recieved a slight stat change, should actually be able to hit targets\
\
--Minor cosmetic update to [[:Category:Carrier|carrier]] hanger doors, they now use the forcefield texture, dm me any issues (such as the doors not working)\
\

\
''(This announcement regards future changes - these features are not currently implemented)''\
\
PSA 2018, state of the game:\
Just a short overview of what's going on in Galaxy's Development.\
\
<strong>Content & Gameplay</strong>\
\
We have alot of content planned, some of which are being worked on as we speak. (Big Content Updates)\
I believe we want to prioritize the reduction of lag before anything else though.\
Bug Fixes & etc. should also be coming along hopefully, depending on [[Rcouret|Rcouret's]] time. (Hopefully some changes to mechanics too, such as [[Warp Drive|warp]])\
\
<strong>Ships & Stuff</strong>\
\
I'm unsure if we want to add more ships into the game at it's current state, we'll see how optimized some of the submissions are.\
The Rebalance isn't going forward right now, but we did make a few examples for Miners, which i'll post below. (I will only present one Example)\
\
<em>---[[Harvester]]--- Agile, fast, fast mining, low orehold\
<nowiki> =S/H= 600/100\
=Speed=75\
=T.Speed=.35\
=Accel=18\
</nowiki>=[[Turrets]] + size= Medium x2\
<nowiki> </nowiki>=[[Warp Drive|Warp drive]]=Yes\
<nowiki> =Cargo Hold=25\
</nowiki>=Ore Hold=400</em>\
\
For all ships - we'll be using the description to determine and help players realize each ship's role.\
All ships will finally have a specified role, no longer is it dedicated to it's Class.\
\
<strong>AGAIN</strong>, we are very limited as to what we can do without [[Rcouret|Rcouret's]] help.\
More to come™\
\
[[Constellation]] buffed to gain another [[turrets|Medium Flak Cannon]] and a [[turrets|Medium Laser]], bringing the total to 4 [[turrets]] (two of each). This will hopefully make it more of a threat to bigger pirates and make it easier to finish off small ships. The price was not greatly affected.\
\
All [[:Category:Admin|admin ships]] removed until further notice to help cut down on lag, and reduce loading times.\
\
Un-suspended all player obtainable ships that were suspended at the beginning of the month as it had no impact on lag. As shown by community and experienced by myself. [//prntscr.com/k0ab5f http://prntscr.com/k0ab5f]\
\
[[Sabre Tooth]] nerfed. 2 barrels removed, speed reduced, and turnrate reduced.\
\
Removed all [[Starbase]] [[Turrets]] and replaced the 23+ Turrets (on level 3 & 4) with 6 Orbital Cannons that do equal DPS. ''(Part 1 of Lag Reduction Updates)''\
* New Orbital Base [[Turrets]], '''<u>S</u>'''mall, '''<u>M</u>'''edium, '''<u>H</u>'''eavy (Base Level 1,2,3) - 2 Turrets for each Level Upgrade.\
* DAMAGE/RANGE INFORMATION:\
** S: 220 Damage, 5500 Range, Decent Accuracy, Low Reload time (Railgun at Top, Laser at Bottom)\
** M: 350 Damage, 6700 Range, Medium Accuracy, Medium Reload time (Railgun Left, Laser Right)\
** H: 500 Damage, 7200 Range, Low Accuracy, High Reload time (Railgun Vertical to Left, Laser Vertical to Right) Railguns/Lasers have the same Damage.\
\
* <u>'''OLD:'''</u> 23 Turrets x 10 Max Level Bases = 230 Turrets constantly searching for targets/script running for each one of them.\
* <u>'''NEW:'''</u> 6 Turrets at Level 1 x 10 Level 1 Bases = 60 Turrets constantly searching for a target, new bases have max. of 6 Turrets.\
* Also changed Base Colors & Materials.\
Base has no Blindspots since all Turrets are Orbital.\
Next: Planets/NPC Changes.\
\
[[Frion I|Frion]] & [[Aqueous II|Aqueous]] now have new Orbital [[Turrets]]:\
* [[Frion I|Frion]] has 8 in total, ranging from M type Turrets to H type turrets about equal in numbers\
\
* [[Aqueous II|Aqueous]] when fully upgraded has 10 turrets, also ranging from M type to H type turrets - 5 turrets each level\
\
* [[Frion I|Frion's]] atmosphere is now 10% bigger\
[[Turrets|Laser Gatling]] \"variant\" released! Added to several ships \"[but we] will leave that for you guys to find out on which.\"\
\
[[Sabre Tooth]] re balanced: 2 [[Spinal Weaponry|medium phasers]] replaced with 4 [[Spinal Weaponry|small phasers]].\

--[[Turrets|Patriotic Mining laser]] recolors\
\
--[[Patriotic Rorqual]] nerfed: | Ore hold: 5850 -> 5200 | Cargo hold: 1170 -> 750 | The reality of this change was it was wrecking the economy, cannot be compared with Woolly since Woolly is far less uncommon than the patriotic rorqual. Regardless the difference between [[Woolly Mammoth|Woolly]] and patriotic rorqual is thin so it's not that large of a deal.\
\
--Quest folder updated\
\
Roblox made an update and it reverted a lot of assets to a previous system we used. This is one of the real examples happening right now. Inside teleporters theres used to be a script, we replaced that system so it doesnt need one. Whatever roblox did reverted any changes to ships without leaving a version history trace. This or something more drastic could be the cause for the [[Galaxy Private Servers|VIP servers]] not functioning properly. This actually happened to aquaous right before we published the Celestial Bodies 1 update and arina & plural had to reconfigure a lot of it to get it working. [I] Personally have no idea how they can \"roll back\" so many changes without leaving a version history trace but it's actually so much effort and such a large setback for us because this seems to happen every other month now. Once the game is back up, if you notice anything different or broken(from a few days ago to present) DM arina or me and we'll try and fix it for the 100th time.\

[[File:Unknown-3.png|centre|thumb|690x690px]]Here's my personal agenda on things I need to get done, right now priority being to reduce lag and here's a list of the largest offenders\
[//trello.com/c/9zWlGvJ0/748-ca-agenda https://trello.com/c/9zWlGvJ0/748-ca-agenda]\
\
[[Nyx]] is now made up half of meshes, part count reduced from 662 to 313 (and lag greatly reduced) it's appearance was not changed for those concerned.\
\
[[Nixesion]] (Fighter) reduced from 96 parts to 26 without altering any appearance/increasing file size.\
\
[[Fury]] & [[Frenzy]] parts reduced from 60 to 36 each without altering any appearance. (File size increased by 100kb/each).\
\
New intro music, few new roaming themes, many new battle themes & new victory music.\
\
As part of a major effort to get lag under control, I have decided to suspend the following ships because they utilize 10% or more of the servers processor by itself. The ships will be restored after being remodeled to a version with less than 10% lag. This takes effect in version .61c5 [[Absolution]], [[Aegis]], [[Andromeda]], [[Archeon]], [[Aurora]], [[Blizzard]], [[Carvainir]], [[E Class]], [[Eclipse]], [[Frankenemi]], [[Ghoul Nyx]], [[Glacier]], [[Grim Reaper]], [[Halloween Ship]], [[Hasatan]], [[Naglfar]], [[Nyx]], [Secret Ship], [[Revelation]], [[Ridgebreaker]], [[Sagittarius]], [[Sovereign]], [[Stormbringer]], [[Tempest]], [[Tengu]], [[Tennhausen]], [[Warlock]] and [[Witch]].\
\
The new music added to the Music Page on the Wiki if you want to listen to it. [//roblox-galaxy-official.wikia.com/wiki/Music http://roblox-galaxy-official.wikia.com/wiki/Music].\
\
[[Nyx]] disabled, it's lag was reduced from in the 40% range to 12-13% but that's still not good enough so I'll work on that soon.\

New Situation Board at the [[Mega Base]] which provides a short description of recent updates/current issues going on with Galaxy. For now, it displays all (non-admin) suspended ships (since that's the problem as of now) & displays a section of what was recently updated. This is targeted towards players that aren't in the discord and helps inform them of why it's disabled and what. The recent update section should provide information on non-version updates, so you'll know if that specific change was applied to that server or not. (For example, a small ship hotfix would not change the latest server version, but it will now show up on the board to let players know this is the latest server with it).\

Shipbuilders, we're looking for these remodels below V _ V - there have already been some submitted, but if you can make a better one than you see in #ship-submissions give it a try. If you want a Remodel / Ship of yours added to #ship-submissions, tag a mod or Admin. Remember, Max. Filesize is 2MB & 500 Parts. Try to make it below either of these.\

With this coming patch, I gave 4 ships some love in order to bring them back on par with the rest of the [[:Category:Dreadnought|dreads]], these ships are as follow;\
\
[[Zeus]]: Received a large buff to its shield hp while losing 1 heavy laser and gaining several mediums. The goal of this is to remove any long range role and make it a close-ranged beast for [[Shields|shield]] dpm. It is also slower now.\
\
[[Leviathan|Levi]]: Restored this ancient beast to its former glory of being the fastest [[:Category:Dreadnought|dread]], known for hunting down damaged dreads. It now has double its previous speed and acceleration. (also a really sick remodel )\
\
[[Sagittarius|Saggi]]: Further established this ships role as a sieging shield-breaker, gave it an extra heavy and slowed it down to maximize its burst potential.\
\
[[Naglfar]]: Buffed its speed by a considerable amount to distinguish its role from the [[Zeus]] for [[Shields|shield]] pvp, it now can handle other capital ships at long range, kiting essentially.\

[[:Category:Freighter|Freighter]] remodels are released.\

[[Interceptor]] [[:Category:Fighters|Fighter]] added temporarily for testing.\
\
Gave all [[:Category:Miner|miners]] (except [[wasp]]) a buff to give a better chance of escaping a [[Pirates|pirate]] ambush, prices will increase temporarily in .57a but should go back down in .57b as I have altered the pricing formula for miners.\

<h1 class=\"mw-customtoggle-56 shipclass\">Version 56</h1>\
<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed content\" id=\"mw-customcollapsible-56\" align=left>\
.56 is the Latest Version. 1 Planet has been added, we call it [[Frion I]]. You're wondering what a planet can do, well let me tell you. 1. It lowers the price of each material, but only on the Planet. (Eco Bonus) 2. It can be upgraded for 12K to get Defensive [[Turrets]]. 3. It acts as your last resort since the [[Starbase|Base]] inside the Planet has 30K total HP. How does it work? If [[Frion I]] should get \"destroyed\" you lose ownership and the ones that got the last hit get the Planet + extra Power for said Planet. It can't be destroyed. [[Frion I]] can be assimilated like every other \"NPC\" base, which means. The first territory to touch it got the Planet. (Power boost doesn't apply). What do we have planned for the future? 2 Words would describe it as, Ground Combat. Also, there will be more planets in the future. Other Fixes / Changes: Fixed Docking in [[Warp Drive|Warp]] Glitch. Fixed Console Errors. Added Buy All / Sell All from Ship. Added a better Targeting Icon Visual.\
\
.56a fixed [[Aliens|Alien]] Icons not being transparent.\
\
Fixed [[Tempest]] Docking point. Fixed [[Prospector]] Docking point.\
\

\
Celebrating 1000+ Discord Users.\
\
Lowered total HP on [[Absolution]].\
\
New [[Industrial Miner]] w/ New [[Turrets|Turret]]!\
\
To clarify, these are miners, so they have that special look. We're obviously not going to add this kind of look to Combat Ships. Don't you worry about designs, I'm sure we know what we're doing. Thanks for reading this very interesting report.\
\
For anyone wondering, we will also be re-making [[Starbase]]s to fit the new Ship Style, bigger docking ports for bigger [[:Category:Dreadnought|Dreadnoughts]] because now we can size the ships realistically.\
\
We want to thank all the players for their continued support through Galaxy's Development. Over the years it has been our goal to reduce server lag but we have been limited in Roblox Studio. With the latest tech Roblox offers we are launching New Modern Ship Designs that will reduce server lag. Plus, the updated Star Base design allows Capital Ships to dock easier.\
\
New [[:Category:Miner|Miner]] models available.\
\
New [[Argonaut]].\
\
New [[Tempura]].\
\
New [[Prospector]].\
\
New [[Wyrm]].\
\
We are a user-generated community and we value our player's opinions. The ship remakes are not set in stone and are open for discussion and voting. Right now we have heard your views about the [[Wyrm|Wrym]] and made adjustments. Next, we will move onto the Rorq. Thank you for everyone's participation.\
\
Don't panic about your stats reset, it's just Roblox database acting up according to [[Rcouret]].\
\
Leave. Galaxy. Before. It. Saves. Your. EMPTY. DATA.\
\
For all ignorant punks, [[Rcouret]] isn't at fault for this. It's Roblox.\
\
Obby placeholder till Roblox database is fixed.\
\
Re-join galaxy servers 10 Times and see if you have it back.\
\
FORMULA FOR PLAYERS THAT WERE RESET. Your Name: Your Bounty: Your Credits: Your Warehouse Level: IF YOU ARE ASKED TO NOT BE IN A GALAXY SERVER, THEN YOU SHOULD LEAVE ASAP ONCE YOUR FORMULA HAS BEEN ACCEPTED. Staff will tell you when your formula is accepted so we can tell you to leave the game and apply the Commands. If we think something is Fishy we will take all the time in the world to figure it out, even if your log is 1000 Entries Long. Liars won't be refunded.\
\
New Icons for Map & Nav!\
\
New Target UI! (& Icons).\
\
A lot more fixes.\
\
The Community in Galaxy is awesome. To better meet your needs we are restructuring staff and bringing in a new Community Advisor/Advisors and a new Shipmaster. Game updates are under rc, the game's owner. Staffing will continue under me. rc thinks you guys rock and will continue to make Galaxy an amazing user-generated experience.\

.55 is the latest version, Fixes / Changes: GUI's not properly coming out of [[Warp Drive|warp]].\
Possibly client isn't receiving packet telling it the warp part has been deleted.\
Add safety to delete warp part/bubble from client if speed has returned to normal after a warp deceleration detected. Make NPC's use the bubble warp technology for long distance targets Only [[ships]] (and [[Starbase|bases]]) destroyed by your team are lootable.\
After a certain time, 20 mins, it becomes available for all to loot. Raise spawn position slightly when teleporting to bases to prevent the jump. Allow base credits to go negative for \"Dump Ore\". Only allow loans for negative balances. During [[endgame]], add bonus to power based on your size to put high pressure on smaller [[factions]].\
If your home square is occupied by another faction, that base becomes a vassal of the larger faction. Squares on Navigation GUI should be bigger for closer things, smaller for further things. Display message when base is taken over. [[Andromeda]] is now a [[:Category:VIP Ship|VIP ship]]. And about 25 more bug fixes.\
\
[[Spinals]] ( Cannons Grey, Phasers Red ) have now different colors to be easily recognized.\
\
[[Aegis]] was fixed.\
\
Upcoming fixes and Solutions:\
\
Players falling into the void once spawned at NPC assimilated bases: Add spawn location to mission bases. NPC Bases made out of turrets once main base was destroyed and players start spawning at NPC bases: Add a MaxLevel value to bases, so know if it even can be upgraded any further. Some ships having mass problems, causing them to drop down in [[Warp Drive|warp]] or normal speed: [[Turrets]], [[:Category:Fighters|fighters]] are currently not included as mass, will add in the mass script. Warp Bubble too big on some Ships: Use something different as mass to determine size of warp bubble. Changes: Need some way for the leader to select different bases. Economy tab should show assimilated bases.\
\
Also working on +52 ships to have the standard weld script, so no parts fall off any longer.\
\
DO NOT SPAWN SHIPS AT ASSIMILATED BASES. WE DO NOT REFUND LOSSES BY OWN BASE WITHOUT VIDEO PROOF.\

.55g is the latest version, Changed / Fixed: Peace start after [[war]] has a 120 second timer similar to War start. (This is so leaders cant simply accept peace to save themselves after base diving).
